On Instagram, she has posted celebrity impressions as well as clips from her Groundlings work and stand-up comedy. On YouTube, she has done character impressions. In 2018, Vulture critic Luke Kelly-Clyne wrote that after seeing Fineman do impressions of Meryl Streep and others, \"As I found out, that extra bit of genius she possesses \u2013 that intangible thing that takes a good impression to a great impression \u2013 is rooted in her ability to create entirely original characters who feel as real as anyone you've ever met,\" concluding, \"Chloe Fineman is absolutely one of the most talented new performers right now, and she's long overdue for a break.\"",
