And they are dead set on making sure that what happened to them doesn\u2019t happen to Finney.",

        "biography": "Kellan Rhude grew up in a military family, moving every few years, which shaped his ability to adapt and connect with people from all walks of life. As an actor, he has appeared in Dexter: New Blood, Showtime\u2019s highest-rated miniseries, and brought a moment of levity to the darkness of David Fincher\u2019s The Killer, which premiered in competition at the 2023 Venice International Film Festival. Having grown up on horror films, it\u2019s no surprise he has been part of projects like The Black Phone for Universal, a major hit that now has a sequel set for fall 2025. He played Floyd Tibbits in Salem\u2019s Lot, based on the Stephen King novel, and will soon star in a horror-thriller alongside Jena Malone, Terrence Howard, and Christopher Lloyd. He also has a role in the climax of Appofeniacs, a new thriller featuring Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s Sean Gunn.\n\nBeyond acting, Kellan loves to sing and play guitar. He\u2019s an avid runner, and one of his favorite memories is swimming with wild spinner dolphins in Hawaii.\n\nHe earned his BFA from Boston University\u2019s College of Fine Arts and is completing a master\u2019s degree in writing at Johns Hopkins University. He writes poetry, essays, and fiction, with the goal of publishing his work in the near future.",
