            "R\u00e9mi Julienne"
        ],
        "biography": "R\u00e9my Julienne (17 April 1930 \u2013 21 January 2021) was a French driving stunt performer and coordinator, assistant director and occasional actor. He was also a rallycross champion and 1956 French motorcross champion.\n\nJulienne was born in 1930, the son of caf\u00e9 owners in the town of Cepoy, 110 km south-east of Paris. During World War II, he was dared by children evacuated from Paris to ride a bicycle across the local canal, which inspired him to start riding motocross.\n\nIn his early 20's Julienne became French motocross champion in 1957, which brought him to the attention of eminent stunt co-coordinator Gil Delamare. Through Delamare, Julienne's first screen appearance in 1964 was replacing actor Jean Marais, and in 1966 he played a German army motorcyclist in La Grande Vadrouille.\n\nAfter Delamare's tragic death during a stunt in 1966, Julienne stepped-in and agreed to fulfill contracts Delamare had signed with various film studios. Julienne's scientific approach which created spectacular on-screen images garnered him admiration within the industry in an age before computer modelling. Working initially in French film and TV, and occasional Hollywood films shot in Europe, his developing reputation led to his employment on the British film The Italian Job. Producer Michael Deeley later commented that \u201cDuring our initial meeting with R\u00e9my, Peter Collinson [the film\u2019s director] and I were delighted to discover that he was prepared to take the chase sequence even further than we had envisaged, suggesting a different range of hair-raising stunts that could be written into the script.\u201d Julienne planned and co-ordinated all of the vehicle sequences, including the epic Mini chase sequence through the streets and roof tops of Turin.\n\n\"Very often people ask, \u2018what was my favourite stunt?\u2019 I\u2019d say the jump between the two Fiat factory roofs must be the one, because it was emotional, because it was difficult. We worked on the ground, we prepared the ramps, calculated distances, speeds etc. [Originally] it was decided I had to do three separate jumps in each Mini. I explained that, as the roof was very wide, we could make the three Minis jump all together\u2026 it looked much better as a shot. It was more complicated, but really amazing.\"\n\nHe resultantly became Hollywood's go-to vehicle stunt coordinator, best publicly known for his stunts on six James Bond films, five of which were directed by John Glen. Julienne became known for Bond sequences which made ordinary cars do extraordinary things, such as the Citroen 2CV in For Your Eyes Only, the Renault 11 in A View to a Kill, and the petrol semi-tanker in Licence to Kill in which a Kenworth performed a wheelie. \"The tanker chase was the most dangerous sequence I ever devised\u201d said Glen, who also noted that Julienne was fastidious in his preparation. ...\n\nSource: Article \"R\u00e9my Julienne\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
