In 1926 he dropped acting to concentrate on being a playwright, later turning one of his most famous plays, \"Blackmail,\" into a screenplay for production under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock. The affiliation with \"Hitch\" continued into the early 1940s, by which time both Bennett and the director were working in Hollywood. He wrote for producers ranging from Cecil B. DeMille to Irwin Allen to the penny-pinching folks at AIP. \"If I couldn't write, I wouldn't want to live,\" commented Bennett, who had projects (including a remake of \"Blackmail\") going right up to the time of his death.",
