His career continued unimpeded through the years of the Nazi regime; the extent to which this can be considered as deliberate collaboration with the Nazis is hotly disputed.\n\nHis best known roles were that of Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust in 1956/57, and as \"Der Schr\u00e4nker\" (The Safecracker) who is the chief judge of the kangaroo court presiding over Peter Lorre in Fritz Lang's M.",
