His comic style was influenced by clown and pantomime traditions. He wore a curly reddish wig, and never spoke during performances (he blew a horn or whistled to communicate). Marx frequently used props such as a walking stick with a built-in bulb horn, and he played the harp in most of his films.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Harpo Marx, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list  of contributors on Wikipedia.",
