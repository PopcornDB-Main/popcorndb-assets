At the age of 25 she was discovered by Gianni Boncompagni who, overwhelmed by her volcanic personality, entrusted her with a part in the iconic TV program \"Non \u00e8 la Rai\". Chosen for her versatility and performance skills, she was the first woman to take the stage as single presenter of the yearly First May Concert. She has worked with prominent directors, switching between comedic and dramatic roles. Since 2000, she has divided her time between the small and the big screen with unforgettable performances such as \"L'ultimo bacio\" by Gabriele Muccino, \"Concorrenza Sleale\" and \"Gente di Roma\" by Ettore Scola, \"The Passion\" by Mel Gibson and many more. She also played several challenging and complex roles such as in \"Venus in Fur\" directed by Valter Malosti.",
