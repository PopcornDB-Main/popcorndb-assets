        "biography": "David Paul Cronenberg\u00a0[CC\u00a0OOnt],\u00a0born 15 March 1943, is a Canadian film director, screenwriter, producer and actor.\u00a0He is a principal originator of the\u00a0body horror\u00a0genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infectious diseases, and the intertwining of the psychological, physical, and technological. Cronenberg is best known for exploring these themes through\u00a0sci-fi\u00a0horror\u00a0films such as Shivers (1975), Scanners (1981), \u00a0Videodrome (1983), and\u00a0The Fly\u00a0(1986). However, he has also directed dramas, psychological thrillers, and\u00a0gangster films.\n\nCronenberg's films have polarized critics and audiences; he has earned critical acclaim and sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence.\u00a0The Village Voice\u00a0called him \"the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world\".\u00a0His films have won numerous awards, including the\u00a0Special Jury Prize\u00a0for\u00a0Crash\u00a0at the\u00a01996 Cannes Film Festival, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually but only at the request of the official jury, who in this case gave the award \"for originality, for daring, and for audacity\".\n\nFrom the\u00a02000s\u00a0to the\u00a02020s, Cronenberg collaborated on several films with\u00a0Viggo Mortensen, including\u00a0A History of Violence (2005),\u00a0Eastern Promises\u00a0(2007),\u00a0A Dangerous Method\u00a0(2011) and\u00a0Crimes of the Future\u00a0(2022). Seven of his films were selected to compete for the\u00a0Palme d'Or, the most recent being\u00a0The Shrouds\u00a0(2024), which was screened at the\u00a02024 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article David Cronenberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, is a full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
