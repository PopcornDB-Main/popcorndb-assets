He acted with Chaplin in six films between 1921 and 1936, cast mostly in clinical or villainous supporting roles. Garcia portrayed the brutal circus director in The Circus (1928), the snobbish butler of the millionaire in City Lights (1931), and the factory owner in Modern Times (1936). He was also a casting director for Chaplin on The Circus, City Lights, and Modern Times.\n\nGarcia was co-founder of the Motion Picture Extras and Supporting Players Association, founded in 1933.",
