He also served as ILM's visual effects supervisor for\u00a0Star Trek Generations\u00a0and\u00a0Star Trek: First Contact, as well as the\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean series. Along with Hal Hickel, Charles Gibson and Allen Hall, Knoll and the trio's work on\u00a0Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\u00a0earned them the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\nKnoll has been praised by directors\u00a0James Cameron,\u00a0Gore Verbinski,\u00a0Guillermo del Toro, and\u00a0Brad Bird. Del Toro, who worked with Knoll for the first time on\u00a0Pacific Rim, stated, \"He basically has the heart of a kid and the mind of a scientist, and that's a great combination.\"\n\nKnoll was also the inventor of Knoll Light Factory, a\u00a0lens flare-generating software inspired by his work at Industrial Light and Magic. He was the Computer Graphics Project Designer on\u00a0The Abyss, an achievement which earned ILM its tenth\u00a0Oscar, and worked on two\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0episodes:\u00a0Star Trek: The Next Generation's pilot episode (\"Encounter at Farpoint\") and the\u00a0Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\u00a0episode \"Explorers\".\u00a0\n\nKnoll had a cameo appearance in\u00a0Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\u00a0as a fighter pilot\u00a0who helped pitch the story of\u00a0Rogue One, a feature film set in the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0series, for which he also worked as writer and executive producer.\n\nJohn Knoll reflected on his work with\u00a0George Lucas\u00a0on the Star Wars prequel trilogy: \"I still feel like I owe George a lot to have been given that opportunity. On those three films, I feel like I got a whole career's worth of experience packed into eight years. George never constricted his thinking to what he knew for sure the tools were capable of; his attitude was, \"Yeah, well, I'm writing what I want to see, so you guys will figure it out.\" I loved that he would constantly throw those challenges out with the confidence [that] you guys will figure it out. That was great.\"\n\nIn 2016, John Knoll and his brother Thomas were inducted into the\u00a0International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nAt the\u00a02019 Oscars, John and his brother Thomas were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award for the original architecture, design and development of Photoshop.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John Knoll, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
