        "biography": "Hegarty graduated from Queen's University, Belfast, with a first class honours in Celtic Languages and Literature.\n\nAfter a brief period as a teacher, Hegarty joined BBC NI in 1983 as the region's first producer of Irish language programmes. Later an Irish Language Unit was established under Kieran's leadership, with many of the programmes being written by him.\n\nThe initial output was on radio but eventually expanded to television. A particular success was the Irish language learning series \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNow You're Talking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nHe later went on to head the merged Education and Irish Units and at the time of his illness he was Head of Interactive and Learning, responsible for formal and life-long learning and new media, as well as all indigenous minority language output for BBC Northern Ireland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both Irish and Ulster Scots.\n\nHegarty chaired the Irish jury at the Celtic Media Festival for several years, and was also instrumental in helping to shape the development of the recently established Irish Language Broadcast Fund.\n\nPat Loughrey, BBC Director Nations & Regions, said: \"Kieran Hegarty was a man of remarkable creativity. He was also delightfully understated and unpretentious in a media world full of melodrama and posture. His easy charm, his steadfast leadership and his friendship will be sorely missed.\"\n\nPeter Johnston, Controller, BBC Northern Ireland, said: \"Kieran was a creative, talented and committed programme-maker. He made an important and lasting contribution to local broadcasting and leaves a rich legacy of programmes, innovative ideas, friendships and happy memories.\"\n\nKieran is survived by his wife Caroline and four children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c twin sons Lorcan and Ferghal, Colum and a daughter Eadaoin.",
