It was there that he met Charles Dullin, a great man from the theater world who passed on his passion for the stage to him and made his cabaret-theatre debut in 1951 with Agn\u00e8s Capri. Jacques Dufilho then begins by playing sketches before turning to the big screen. In 1939, he participated in Marc All\u00e9gret's project in the film \"Le Corsaire\" but the film remained unfinished. Jacques Dufilho is not worried about it as two years later, he plays the role of a lumberjack in Andr\u00e9 Zwobada's feature film \"Croisi\u00e8res Sid\u00e9rales\".\n\nSubsequently, the actor chained the roles in the cinema but it was in 1949 that he was noticed by the general public in \"La Ferme des Sept P\u00e9ch\u00e9s\" by Jean-Devaivre. Jacques Dufilho also went to the theater and went on stage for the first time in Dostoyevsky's play, \"The Brothers Karamazov\" directed by Andr\u00e9 Barsacq. When the Second World War broke out, Jacques Dufilho was part of the 2nd Hussard Regiment, particularly in the 29th infantry division reconnaissance group as he received the Legion of Honor in 1998. In 1953, he played in the play by Moli\u00e8re \"The Doctor Despite Him\" under the direction of Jean-Pierre Darras. The following year, he returned with Andr\u00e9 Barsacq to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Atelier in \"Colombe\" by Jean Anouilh. He still plays in the cinema as in \"Marie-Antoinette, Reine De France\" by Jean Delannoy in 1956. Same year, same director, he plays in \"Notre-Dame De Paris\".\n\nIn 1961 and 1962, Jacques Dufilho returned to the stage with Andr\u00e9 Barsacq in \"Les Maxibules\" by Marcel Aym\u00e9 and \"L'Avare\" by Moli\u00e8re. The actor made an impression in \"The Guardian\", adapted from the English play \"The Caretaker\" by Harold Pinter. The year 1978 marks a new turning point in the career of Jacques Dufilho, with the film \"Le Crabe-Tambour\" by Pierre Schoendoerffer, thanks to his interpretation of the role of the chief mechanic in the film, he will be rewarded with a C\u00e9sar in the Best Supporting Actor category. In 1980, he played Adrien Dussart in \"A bad son\" by Claude Sautet, which earned him a second C\u00e9sar award, still in the same category. At the theater, in 1988 the actor was awarded the Moli\u00e8re du Com\u00e9dien for his role in Herb Gardner's play \"Je Ne Suis Pas Rappaport\" directed by Georges Wilson. Over the years, Jacques Dufilho will play under the direction of Louis Malle, Claude Chabrol, Andr\u00e9 Hunebelle, Yves Robert and many others. In 1999, he played in \"C'est Quoi La Vie?\" by Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron, which earned him a new nomination for the C\u00e9sars. On television, he received the Seven d'Or for best actor after his role in the film \"Une Femme Innocente\". In 2003 he released his autobiography \"Les Sir\u00e8nes Du Bateau-Loup\" published by Fayard.\n\nThe actor died on August 28, 2005 in Ponsamp\u00e8re at the age of 91 after playing his last role in \"Up There, A King Above The Clouds\" by Pierre Schoendoerffer.",
