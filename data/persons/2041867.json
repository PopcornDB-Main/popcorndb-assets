Her father Joe Williams, an African-American professional football player and her uncle Alfie Lisk a professional stock car and motorcycle racer. Angelica excelled at every sport imaginable as a child and teenager. Her mother fought to keep her in dance and modeling, but all Angelica wanted to do was beat boys at sports. She moved away from her small town of Trenton Ontario when she was scouted by a track and field coach to move to Toronto and train for the Olympic's. When in the big city she was immediately drawn to the arts. After booking a few commercials, dancing in videos and small acting roles, as well as singing in the popular group Simply Majestic,  Angelica was introduced to the world of stunts in 1997 by top Canadian Stunt coordinator Branko Racki while playing a Henchwoman in the movie Half Baked.",
