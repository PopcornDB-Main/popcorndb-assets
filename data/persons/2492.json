        "biography": "Jack Benny (February 14, 1894 \u2013 December 26, 1974) was an American comedian, vaudevillian, and actor for radio, television, and film. Widely recognized as one of the leading American entertainers of the 20th century, Benny played the role of the comic penny-pinching miser, insisting on remaining 39 years old on stage despite his actual age, and often playing the violin badly.\n\nBenny was known for his comic timing and his ability to get laughs with either a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated \"Well!\" His radio and television programs, tremendously popular from the 1930s to the 1960s, were a foundational influence on the situation comedy genre. Dean Martin, on the celebrity roast for Johnny Carson in November 1973, introduced Benny as \"the Satchel Paige of the world of comedy.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jack Benny, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
