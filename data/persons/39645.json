Unfortunately, not only does Fernand have to put up with the thoroughly modern Patricia and her nauseating boyfriend, but he also had to contend with the Mexican\u2019s trigger-happy former employees, who are determined to make a claim.",

        "biography": "Fran\u00e7ois Jean Blanche, known as \"Francis Blanche\" (20 July 1921 \u2013 6 July 1974) was a French actor, singer, humorist and author. He was a very popular figure on stage, radio and in films, during the 1950s and 1960s. His two daughters, Barbara & Dominique, are artists with their studios in Eze.\n\nBlanche was born in an artistic family, mainly of stage actors\u2014including his father Louis Blanche and his uncle, Emmanuel Blanche, who was a painter\u2014. He completed his secondary schooling at fourteen, the youngest in France to do so at the time.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Blanche was part of Robert Dh\u00e9ry's theatrical company Les Branquignols, with whom he played in the film Ah! Les belles bacchantes, starring Robert Dh\u00e9ry, Colette Brosset (Dh\u00e9ry's then-wife), and Louis de Fun\u00e8s; directed by Jean Loubignac in 1954.\n\nBlanche teamed up with Pierre Dac to form a comic duo best remembered for Le S\u00e2r Rabindranath Duval, a sketch about a phony and nonsensical Indian clairvoyant and guru (1957). They also created a popular and equally nonsensical radiophonic series, loosely based on a highly improbable espionage and conspiration plot, Malheur aux barbus, which was broadcast on Paris Inter in 213 episodes from 1951 to 1952. The same plot and characters were revived on Europe 1 in a series called Sign\u00e9 Furax, enjoying no less than 1,034 daily episodes between 1956 and 1960. Both broadcasts were phenomenal audience successes in the pre-television era. Blanche was also renowned for broadcasting phone pranks, in which he entertained listeners by making the most improbable situations sound plausible.\n\nHe wrote poems, and the lyrics of 673 songs. On stage, he acted in Tartuffe and N\u00e9ron and, in 1955, Chevalier du Ciel, an operetta by Luis Mariano at the Ga\u00eet\u00e9-Lyrique theatre.\n\nBlanche also enjoyed a successful cinematographic career, both as an actor and scriptwriter. He appeared as a hard-headed German colonel (\"Obersturmf\u00fchrer Schulz\") opposite Brigitte Bardot in Babette s'en va-t-en guerre (1959). He was one of the favourite actors of French filmmaker Georges Lautner, and played Ma\u00eetre Folace (a shady solicitor counselling a colourful gangster mob) in Les Tontons flingueurs (1963). Blanche also appeared in Boris Vassilief's Les Barbouzes (1964).\n\nHe delighted in parodying classical music, adapting famous works such as Schubert's \"Die Forelle\" (The Trout) into a crazy and slightly risqu\u00e9 piece about a 16-year-old romantic girl obsessed with Schubert's song to the point of giving birth to a live trout while performing it on her piano. Similarly, he turned Beethoven's 5th Symphony into a lengthy and quite repetitive musical glorification of the clothes peg and its fictitious inventor, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie-Victor Opdebec.\n\nBlanche died at the age of 52, from a heart attack with a background of untreated Type 1 diabetes. He is buried in \u00c8ze cemetery.\n\nSource: Article \"Francis Blanche\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
