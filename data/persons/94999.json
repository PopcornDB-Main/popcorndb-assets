Though the TV exposure powered his 1993 CD \"Try My Love\" to gold status, Jordan opted mainly for non-musical performing instead. After appearing in several TV films, including \"Boys Will Be Boys\" (1994) and \"Twisted Desire\" (1996), as well as in a bit part in Mike Figgis Oscar- winning drama \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995), Jordan bolstered his big- screen resume with a role in Gregg Araki's \"Nowhere\" (1997). The last film in Araki's \"teen apocalypse trilogy\", Nowhere enabled Jordan to play off his teen popster roots as a gay, drug-addicted musician in Los Angeles' youth underground.",
