        "biography": "Torsten Voges (born 1962 in Germany) is a German actor with a film career in Hollywood. He began his acting training in Germany and later studied at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. After completing his studies, he initially returned to Germany, where he performed at the Theater am Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and held a six-year engagement at the D\u00fcsseldorfer Schauspielhaus. In 1997, Voges moved to Hollywood and landed a role in The Big Lebowski (1998), playing the German nihilist Franz. Due to his distinctive height of 2.05 meters, he was frequently cast in eccentric or intimidating roles, including a Norwegian Satanist in The Lords of Salem (2012). His other film appearances include 8mm (1999), Rent a Man (1999), and Funny People (2009). He also made guest appearances in TV series such as Seinfeld and Malcolm in the Middle and had a recurring role in Eastwick (2009). Voges was married for the second time and has an adult daughter. After spending several years in the United States, he relocated back to Germany but remains active in Hollywood.",
