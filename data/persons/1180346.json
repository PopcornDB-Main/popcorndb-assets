        "biography": "Anthony Carrigan (born January 2, 1983) is an American actor. From 2018 to 2023, he portrayed Chechen mobster NoHo Hank in the HBO series Barry, for which he was nominated three times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2019, 2022, and 2023. He is also known for playing Tyler Davies in the television series The Forgotten (2009\u20132010), Victor Zsasz in the FOX series Gotham (2014\u20132019), and robot Dennis Caleb McCoy in Bill & Ted Face the Music (2020).\n\nCarrigan was born January 2, 1983, in Winchester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Winchester High School and attended Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nSince childhood, Carrigan has had alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. He had mild symptoms growing up with only small, manageable bald spots, but he started losing more hair in his 20s and has spoken of wearing makeup and artificial eyebrows while filming The Forgotten. He is now known for his complete lack of hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, and has incorporated this into his career, often being typecast as a television villain.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Anthony Carrigan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
