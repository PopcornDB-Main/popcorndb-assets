Mauro, father of 2 children, was born in the South Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo, where, after having been a robber and traffic manager, he found his way out in rap, entering music and realizing his true gift. The origin of the nickname Sabotage was due to being always able to circumvent the laws with tremendous success, such as entering balls, parties and nightclubs without permissions, and coming out unscathed from countless confusions. Considered a legend in the South Zone, he inspired several rappers, such as Rhossi, Pavilh\u00e3o 9, in addition to having taught Paulo Miklos how to be a worthy trickster, in the film \"O Invasor\", by Beto Brant, with whom he even wrote a song.",
