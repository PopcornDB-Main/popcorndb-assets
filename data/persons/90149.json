        "biography": "Big Boy (born Kurt Alexander; September 8, 1969) is a nationally syndicated American radio host and actor. His stage name derives from his formerly large build, which he modified through duodenal switch surgery in 2003, leading to a nearly fatal weight loss of over 250 pounds. He became famous as the literally larger-than-life Big Boy working as a 400-pound bodyguard for hip-hop group The Pharcyde when he began his radio career in 1994 at KPWR/Los Angeles.  His comedic and conversational skills led to success with overnight and afternoon shows before KPWR (Power 106) asked him to host the station\u2019s morning show in 1997. The result was Big Boy\u2019s Neighborhood, a show that combined hip-hop music, celebrity guests, Hollywood gossip and prank phone calls (performed by alter ego Luther Luffeigh). With the help of a supporting cast that over the years has included Hollywood reporter Luscious Liz Hernandez, \u201cstuntman\u201d Louie G and entertainment correspondent Natalia Perez, Big Boy\u2019s Neighborhood quickly enjoyed huge success among younger urban listeners. The success of the morning show led to the 2006 creation of Big Boy\u2019s Hip Hop Spot, a weekend show focusing on hip hop and Hollywood news.\n\nAfter a decade on the air in Los Angeles, ABC Radio Network began syndicating his daily and weekend shows nationwide in 2007. At its peak, his programs were heard in 35 major markets. In February 2015, Big Boy moved his show to KRRL (Real 92.3) /Los Angeles.\n\nHe was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2015.",
