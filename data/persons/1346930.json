He worked on many films with Jackie Chan and his stunt team and even did a few stunts himself. He was known more as a character actor than a stuntman, often playing police officials, including controversially in the movie High Risk (1995), which mocked Jackie Chan. In the movie Gorgeous (1999) he and fellow Jackie Chan bodyguard, Ken Lo, parody their real selves by playing bodyguards to the films antagonist L. W. Lo, played by Emil Chau.",
