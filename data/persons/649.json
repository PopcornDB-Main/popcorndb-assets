He attended Ascham Preparatory School in Eastbourne, Sussex, England, in the 1940s, where he won the Acting Cup. One of his many television roles was as the Chief Scientist in the Doctor Who story The War Games in 1969.\n\nIn his 2006 memoir Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, British actor Rupert Everett describes an encounter with Dobtcheff on the boat train to Paris, and reveals his extraordinary reputation as the \"patron saint\" of the acting profession, stating that Dobtcheff \"was legendary not so much for his acting as for his magical ability to catch every first night in the country\". Widely travelled and prone to pop up in the most unlikely of locales, if unable to attend an opening night, Dobtcheff will still endeavour to send the cast a card wishing the production good luck.\n\nDobtcheff is set to appear in the upcoming Doctor Who audio drama The Children of Seth where he'll be playing the role of Shamur, set for release in December 2011.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Vernon Dobtcheff, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
