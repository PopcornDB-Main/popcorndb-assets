        "biography": "Kari Ky\u00f6sti V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (born 17 September 1953 in Ivalo) is a Finnish actor and director. Domestically he is a member of the Ryhm\u00e4teatteri group of actors. He was introduced to international audiences by Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki; and belongs to the list of his \"trusted\" stable of actors.\n\nHis most challenging role has been the eponymous mafia hitman of Rosso, for which he learned all his lines phonetically, without previously speaking a word of Italian. Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen was featured in Star Wreck, a Finnish sci-fi parody where he played the Russian president. He also starred in Jim Jarmusch's 1991 film Night on Earth.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
