While Liebman said he had strained relations with stars G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere, Blier defended him during and after filming.\n\nLiebman made his directorial debut with Je suis supporter du Standard (2013).\n\nSource: Article \"Riton Liebman\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
