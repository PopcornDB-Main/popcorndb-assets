Her father, Govind Kiswani, was an engineer with the Indian Railways, and her mother, Leela, was a gynaecologist who worked with the Indian Army. Her father wanted to give her a \"modern\" sounding name, and came up with \"Lillete\" as a faux-French derivation of her mother's name, Leela, with the intended meaning being \"little Leela.\" Lillete, however, never liked her name \"from day one\" due to personal reasons, such as getting made fun of when she was younger.",
