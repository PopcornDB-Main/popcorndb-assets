        "biography": "Edward John \"Eddie\" Izzard (born 7 February 1962) is an English stand-up comedian and actor. Her comedy style takes the form of rambling, whimsical monologue and self-referential pantomime.\n\nIzzard's works include stand-up sets Unrepeatable, Definite Article, Glorious, Dress to Kill, Circle, Sexie and Stripped. She had a starring role in the television series The Riches as Wayne Malloy and has appeared in many motion pictures such as Ocean's Twelve, Ocean's Thirteen, Mystery Men, The Cat's Meow, Across the Universe, and Valkyrie.\n\nShe has cited her main comedy role model as Monty Python, and John Cleese once referred to her as the \"Lost Python\". In 2009, she completed 43 marathons in 51 days for Sport Relief in spite of having no prior history of long-distance running.  Izzard is genderfluid and has said she prefers she and her pronouns, but \"[doesn't] mind\" he and him.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Eddie Izzard, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
