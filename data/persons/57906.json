        "biography": "Andrew Dice Clay is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He rose to prominence in the late 1980s with a brash, deliberately offensive persona known as \"The Diceman\". In 1990, he became the first stand-up comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden for two consecutive nights. That same year, he played the lead role in the comedy-mystery film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane.\n\nClay has appeared in several films and television shows, including critically acclaimed supporting roles in Blue Jasmine and A Star Is Born, the latter of which earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. He continues his acting career while also touring and performing stand-up. The television show Dice aired on Showtime for two seasons. He also launched a podcast, I'm Ova Hea' Now, in September 2018.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Andrew Dice Clay, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
