        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSetsuko Hara (June 17, 1920 \u2013 September 5, 2015) was a Japanese actress who appeared in six of Yasujir\u014d Ozu's films, most notably as Noriko in the \"Noriko Trilogy\": Late Spring (1949), Early Summer (1951), and Tokyo Story (1953). Her other films for Ozu were Tokyo Twilight (1957), Late Autumn (1960), and finally The End of Summer in 1961.\n\nShe was born\u00a0 Masae Aida in Yokohama, Kanagawa prefecture. She came to prominence as an actress at an early age, in the 1937 German-Japanese co-production Die Tochter des Samurai (Daughter of the Samurai), known in Japan as Atarashiki Tsuchi (The New Earth), directed by Arnold Fanck and Mansaku Itami.\n\nShe also starred in films by Akira Kurosawa, Mikio Naruse, and other prominent directors.\n\nShe was called \"the Eternal Virgin\" in Japan and is a symbol of the golden era of Japanese cinema of the 1950s. She suddenly quit acting in 1963 (the same year as Ozu's death), and led a secluded life in Kamakura, refusing all interviews and photographs. Her last major role was Riku, wife of \u014cishi Yoshio, in the 1962 film Chushingura. She was the inspiration for the protagonist of the 2001 movie Millennium Actress.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Setsuko Hara, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
