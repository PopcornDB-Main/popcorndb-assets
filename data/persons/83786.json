        "biography": "Walter Leland Cronkite, Jr. (November 4, 1916 \u2013 July 17, 2009) was an American broadcast journalist, best known as anchorman for the CBS Evening News for 19 years (1962\u201381). During the heyday of CBS News in the 1960s and 1970s, he was often cited as \"the most trusted man in America\" after being so named in an opinion poll. Although he reported many events from 1937 to 1981, including bombing in World War II, the Nuremberg trials, combat in the Vietnam War, the death of President John F. Kennedy, the death of civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King, Jr., Watergate, and the Iran Hostage Crisis, he was known for extensive TV coverage of the U.S. space program, from Project Mercury to the Moon landings to the Space Shuttle. He was the only non-NASA recipient of a Moon-rock award. Cronkite is well known for his departing catchphrase \"And that's the way it is,\" followed by the date on which the appearance is aired.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Walter Cronkite, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",
