        "biography": "Charles Lewis Napier (April 12, 1936 \u2013 October 5, 2011) was a prolific American actor known for his many supporting and occasional leading roles in television and film. Born near Scottsville, Kentucky, Napier served in the U.S. Army before pursuing higher education, earning a degree in art from Western Kentucky University. He initially worked as a sports coach and art teacher before dedicating himself to acting.\n\nNapier gained early attention after starring in several low-budget films by director Russ Meyer, including his debut in Cherry, Harry & Raquel! (1969). He became well-known for his portrayal of tough, authoritative characters such as police officers, soldiers, and villains often with a rugged or corrupt edge. Among his memorable roles are the short-tempered country singer Tucker McElroy in The Blues Brothers (1980), CIA officer Marshall Murdock in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), and multiple collaborations with director Jonathan Demme in films like The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Philadelphia (1993).\n\nHe also had notable appearances in television, including roles in The A-Team, The Oregon Trail, Star Trek: The Original Series, and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Napier was appreciated for his strong voice, steely gaze, and distinct broad chin, which made him a standout character actor.\n\nNapier passed away in 2011 in Bakersfield, California, due to thrombosis at the age of 75. He also published a book about his life titled Square Jaw and Big Heart",
