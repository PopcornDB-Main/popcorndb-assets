Stranded in the New Mexico desert, the two catch a break when a passing truck driver offers Amy a ride to a nearby caf\u00e9 to call for help. Meanwhile, Jeff is able to fix the car and make his way to the caf\u00e9, but Amy isn't there. He tracks down the trucker -- who tells the police he's never seen Jeff or his wife before. Jeff then begins a desperate, frenzied search for Amy.",
