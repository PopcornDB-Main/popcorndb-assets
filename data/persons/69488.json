        "biography": "Giovanni \"Nanni\" Moretti (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8nanni mo\u02c8retti]; born 19 August 1953; Brunico) is an Italian film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. The Palme d'Or winner in 2001, in 2012 he was the President of the Jury at the Cannes Film Festival. His films have won accolades including a Palme d'Or at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival for \"The Son's Room\", a Silver Bear at the 1986 Berlin Film Festival for \"The Mass is Ended\" and a Silver Lion at the 1981 Venice Film Festival for \"Sweet Dreams\", in addition to the David di Donatello Award for Best Film on three occasions (for \"Caro diario\" in 1994, \"The Son's Room\" in 2001 and \"Il caimano\" in 2006).\n\nMoretti was born in Bruneck, Italy to Roman parents who were both teachers. His father was the late epigraphist Luigi Moretti, a Greek teacher at Sapienza University of Rome. His brother is literary scholar Franco Moretti. While growing up Moretti discovered his two passions, the cinema and water polo. Having finished his studies he pursued a career as a producer, and in 1973 directed his first two short films: P\u00e2t\u00e9 de bourgeois and The Defeat (La sconfitta). In 1976, Nanni Moretti's first feature film Io sono un autarchico (I Am Self-Sufficient) was released. In 1978, he wrote, directed and starred in the movie Ecce Bombo, which tells the story of a student having problems with his entourage. It was screened at the Cannes Festival. Sogni d'oro won the Silver Lion at the 38th Venice International Film Festival. La messa \u00e8 finita won the Silver Bear \u2013 Special Jury Prize at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival. He may be best known for his films Caro diario (Dear Diary, 1993; followed in 1998 by a sequel, Aprile) and La stanza del figlio (The Son's Room, 2001), the latter of which won the Palme d'Or at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMoretti has used certain actors several times in his films, generally playing minor roles. His father Luigi appears in 6 films, Dario Cantarelli and Mauro Fabretti in 5, Antonio Petrocelli in 4. More notable Italian actors he has employed frequently in his films include Silvio Orlando, who appears in 5 films (including the role of protagonist in Il caimano) and Laura Morante, who was featured in Sogni d'oro, Bianca and The Son's Room.[citation needed]. Having played waterpolo in the B division of the Italian championship, his experience later inspired his film Palombella Rossa (\"palombella,\" which literally means \"little pigeon,\" refers to a type of lob shot). His other work has not been widely seen outside Europe, but within his country Moretti is known as a maker of wryly humorous and eccentric films, usually starring himself. His most recent role was in the film Mia Madre (My Mother, 2015) Moretti is also an outspoken political leftist. In 2002, he organized street protests against the government of Silvio Berlusconi. Il caimano (2006) is in part about Berlusconi's controversies: in one of the three portraits of the Italian prime minister Moretti himself plays Berlusconi. Aprile also deals with Italy's political situation and Moretti's views on it. His 2011 film We Have a Pope screened In Competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.",
