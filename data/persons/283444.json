        "biography": "Tony Robbins\u00a0(born Anthony Jay Mahavoric, ht: 6'8\") is an European-American author, coach, speaker, and\u00a0philanthropist; he is of Croatian-American heritage. He is known for his infomercials, seminars, and\u00a0self-help books\u00a0including the books\u00a0Unlimited Power\u00a0and\u00a0Awaken the Giant Within. He's also known for his role in the film Shallow Hal as himself, and appeared in Men in Black as an alien being watched on a monitor. He wears size 18 8E shoes.\n\nHis parents divorced when he was 7 and his mother remarried several times, including a marriage with Jim Robbins, a former semi-professional baseball player who legally adopted Anthony when he was 12. During high school, Robbins grew ten inches in a year, a growth spurt later attributed to a\u00a0pituitary tumor.\n\nWhen he was 17 years old, he left home and never returned. Robbins later worked as a janitor, and did not attend college. One day he asked the landlord on site, who was a family friend, about how he became so successful. The landlord then told him that he started to turn his life around after going to a\u00a0Jim Rohn\u00a0seminar.\n\nRobbins began promoting seminars for\u00a0motivational speaker\u00a0and author\u00a0Jim Rohn\u00a0when he was 17 years old.\u00a0He subsequently learned to\u00a0firewalk\u00a0and incorporated it into his seminars.\n\nRobbins has worked on an individual basis with\u00a0Bill Clinton, Justin Tuck, Hugh Jackman, and\u00a0Pitbull.\u00a0He has counseled American businessmen\u00a0Peter Guber,\u00a0Steve Wynn, and\u00a0Marc Benioff.\n\nIn July 2010,\u00a0NBC\u00a0debuted \"Breakthrough with Tony Robbins\", a reality show that followed Robbins as he helped the show's participants face their personal challenges. NBC canceled the show after airing two of the planned six episodes due to low viewership. In March 2012, the\u00a0OWN Network\u00a0picked up the show for another season beginning with the original first season set to re-run and thereafter leading directly into the new 2012 season.\u00a0In April 2012, Robbins began cohosting\u00a0Oprah's Lifeclass\u00a0on the OWN Network.\n\nIn 2015, filmmaker\u00a0Joe Berlinger\u00a0directed and produced the documentary\u00a0Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru, about the Tony Robbins event \"Date with Destiny\" after filming it in Boca Raton, Florida, in December 2014.\u00a0It premiered at the\u00a0South by Southwest\u00a0film festival in March 2016.",
