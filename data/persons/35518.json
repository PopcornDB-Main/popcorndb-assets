        "biography": "Harry Groener is a German-born American actor and dancer born on September 10, 1951, in Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany, to a musical family with an opera singer mother and concert pianist father. He emigrated to the United States with his family when he was two years old and later apprenticed with the San Francisco Ballet before studying drama at the University of Washington. Groener began his career in theater, making his Broadway debut in the 1979 production of \"Oklahoma!\" and going on to appear in shows including \"Cats,\" \"Crazy for You,\" and \"Copenhagen,\" earning several Tony nominations for musicals like \"Oklahoma!\" and \"Cats.\" He transitioned successfully to television and film, becoming perhaps best known for playing Mayor Wilkins in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (seasons 3, 4 and 7), while also appearing in Dear John as Ralph Drang, How I Met Your Mother as Clint, and Mad About You as Lance Brockwell. His extensive television work includes multiple Star Trek series appearances, playing Tam Elbrun in The Next Generation's \"Tin Man\" episode, the Nechani Magistrate in Voyager's \"Sacred Ground\" episode, and Minister Nathan Samuels in Enterprise's \"Demons\" and \"Terra Prime\" episodes, and his film credits include A Cure for Wellness (2016), Patch Adams (1998) and Road to Perdition (2002). He has been married to Dawn Didawick since September 19, 1978, and his versatility as both a stage and screen actor, combined with his memorable villainous turn as the charming yet sinister Mayor Wilkins, has made him a respected figure in both theater and television.",
