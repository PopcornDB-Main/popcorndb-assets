        "biography": "Tatyana Marisol Ali (born January 24, 1979) is an American actress and singer. She's best known for her role as Ashley Banks on the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\n\nAt the age of four she started singing and got a taste of fame when she begged her mother to take her to an audition for Sesame Street. In 1985, as a 6-year-old, she began her acting career as a regular performer on the\u00a0PBS\u00a0children's educational program\u00a0Sesame Street.\n\nShe went on to perform in many productions in her native city, New York, including the Broadway show Fences--with James Earl Jones and, later, Billy Dee Williams--and the off-Broadway show Orfeo del Campo. When she was seven, she appeared on Star Search and won twice, receiving a four-star rating when she appeared for a second time.\n\nAt age 11, she moved from New York to Los Angeles to establish her career and not long afterwords landed her breakthrough role as Ashley Banks, Will Smith's character's cousin, on the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990-1996).\n\nWhile filming The Fresh Prince, she also had side projects, including guest roles in television shows such as The Cosby Show (1984), The All New Mickey Mouse Club (1989) (aka The Mickey Mouse Club), Kyno's Storytime (1992), Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1990), and Foster's Field Trip (1994).\n\nHer vocal talent was featured on several episodes of\u00a0Fresh Prince\u00a0in later seasons, prompting the show's star\u00a0Will Smith\u00a0to ask her if she would seriously consider pursuing a musical career. She ultimately decided, for the time being, to continue to concentrate on her acting career. In the series' final season, however, she performed several songs, and she began to be cleaned for her musical debut, the culmination of which was her debut album\u00a0Kiss The Sky\u00a0in 1998. It was\u00a0certified gold\u00a0in early 1999, only months after its release. \"Boy You Knock Me Out\" featuring Will Smith\u2014which peaked at No. 3 and is her biggest hit to date.\n\nShe made an appearance on Smith's album\u00a0Willennium\u00a0on the track \"Who Am I\" with\u00a0MC Lyte. In early 2008, she performed on the song \"Yes We Can\", a will.i.am project supporting\u00a0Barack Obama's presidential campaign. She also appeared in the subsequent music video, which garnered coverage on the \"What the Buzz\" segment of\u00a0ABC's\u00a0World News Now. In January 2014, she released an EP titled Hello.\n\nApart from her musical career, she continued to land roles in films such as\u00a0The Brothers,\u00a0Glory Road, and\u00a0Nora's Hair Salon\u00a0(and its sequel), among others. From 2009 to 2010 she produced and starred in the\u00a0BET\u00a0web series\u00a0Buppies.\n\nShe was on\u00a0recurring status\u00a0on the\u00a0CBS\u00a0soap opera\u00a0The Young and the Restless as Roxanne\u00a0from 2007 to 2013. She starred in the\u00a0TV One\u00a0original series\u00a0Love That Girl!\u00a0as Tyana (whose name was derived from Ali's given name). In 2013, she co-starred as Maya in the\u00a0BET\u00a0comedy\u00a0Second Generation Wayans, alongside\u00a0Craig Wayans\u00a0and\u00a0Damien Dante Wayans.\n\nIn 2011, she received the Living Legacy Award from the Caribbean Heritage Organization in Los Angeles.",
