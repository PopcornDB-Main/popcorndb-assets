A daughter of actor\u00a0Ernie Lively, she made her professional debut in his directorial project\u00a0Sandman\u00a0(1998). She had her\u00a0breakthrough\u00a0role in\u00a0The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u00a0(2005) and\u00a0its 2008 sequel. Lively achieved stardom with her portrayal of\u00a0Serena van der Woodsen\u00a0in\u00a0the CW\u00a0teen drama television series\u00a0Gossip Girl\u00a0(2007\u20132012). During this period, she also took on supporting roles in the romantic comedies\u00a0New York, I Love You (2008) and\u00a0The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009), as well as in the thrillers\u00a0The Town\u00a0(2010) and\u00a0Savages\u00a0(2012).\n\nLively shifted her focus to films in the ensuing years. She starred in the romantic fantasy\u00a0The Age of Adaline\u00a0(2015), the survival film\u00a0The Shallows (2016), the comedy\u00a0Caf\u00e9 Society\u00a0(2016), and the comedy thriller\u00a0A Simple Favor\u00a0(2018) and\u00a0its 2025 sequel.
