        "biography": "Moneca got her feature film break in MGM's \"Agent Cody Banks\" where she seductively flirted with Frankie Muniz, giving him a holographic lesson on how to act with girls. This turned out to be a springboard, launching her into various roles on projects such as \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Supernatural\", as well as a recurring role on \"Smallville\". In 2006, Moneca was cast in \"Kill Kill Faster Faster\", an indie based on the acclaimed novel by Joel Rose. She stars opposite fellow Canadians Gil Bellows and Lisa Ray. When filming wrapped on location in Rotterdam, Holland, she returned to her hometown of Vancouver, B.C. to join the cast of \"4: Rise of the Silver Surfer\", the sequel to 20th Century Fox's \"Fantastic Four\". By the end of the year, Moneca began production on the Warner Bros./Legendary Pictures/Bryan Singer produced horror anthology \"Trick 'r Treat\". The film takes place on Halloween night, intertwining four story-lines with an ensemble cast that includes Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Dylan Baker & Leslie Bibb. Early 2011 found Moneca working opposite Cory Monteith & Dustin Milligan in the improvised Carl Bessai comedy, \"Sisters & Brothers\", the follow-up to \"Mothers & Daughters\" and \"Fathers & Sons\". She completed filming the thriller, \"Three Days in Havana\" on location in Havana, Cuba & has re-teamed with Gil Bellows for this picture. The cast also includes Kathleen Robertson, Tygh Runyan, Greg Wise & Don McKellar.",
