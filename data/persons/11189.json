                "overview": "In this riot of frantic disguises and mistaken identities, Victor Pivert, a blustering, bigoted French factory owner, finds himself taken hostage by Slimane, an Arab rebel leader. The two dress up as rabbis as they try to elude not only assasins from Slimane's country, but also the police, who think Pivert is a murderer. Pivert ends up posing as Rabbi Jacob, a beloved figure who's returned to France for his first visit after 30 years in the United States. Adding to the confusion are Pivert's dentist-wife, who thinks her husband is leaving her for another woman, their daughter, who's about to get married, and a Parisian neighborhood filled with people eager to celebrate the return of Rabbi Jacob.",

He played the role of the soldier Georges in Roger Vadim's Circle of Love, a film adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's scandalous play La Ronde (play). Between 1964 and 1966, Claude Giraud played the part of Philippe de Plessis-Belli\u00e8res beside Mich\u00e8le Mercier in three Ang\u00e9lique films: Ang\u00e9lique, Marquise des Anges, Marvelous Angelique, and Angelique and the King. He returned to the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise in 1972 and became the 460th soci\u00e9taire in 1976. He left again in 1982 to join Jean-Laurent Cochet's newly created Th\u00e9\u00e2tre H\u00e9bertot.\n\nHe gained fame in TV series as hero Morgan/Jacques de Saint-Hermine in the adventure series Les Compagnons de J\u00e9hu by Michel Drach adapted from the eponymous novel by Alexandre Dumas. Bernard Toublanc-Michel engaged him in 1967 for the role of d'Aulnay in Adolphe ou l'\u00e2ge tendre. The TV series Les rois maudits, where he played the role of Sir Roger Mortimer, was another huge success. In 1973, he played the fictional Arab revolutionary leader Mohamed Larbi Slimane, who poses as Rabbi Zeiligman in The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob with Louis de Fun\u00e8s. In the TV movie Mamie Rose (1976) he played Claude Jade's husband R\u00e9gis, whose marriage is saved by an au-pair granny played by Gis\u00e8le Casadesus.\n\nOther TV series include Mathias Sandorf (1979), in which he played corrupt banker Silas Toronthal, based on Jules Verne's eponymous novel.\n\nHe married Catherine Marquand (1943-2012), a fellow acting student at the Conservatoire, in 1963. They had a son, Louis (*1963), and a daughter, Marianne (*1966), who is also an actress and married to French actor and director Jean Martinez. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Claude Giraud\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
