        "biography": "Rita Cadillac (born Nicole Yasterbelsky; 18 May 1936 \u2013 4 April 1995) was a French dancer, singer, and actress.\n\nCadillac was born in Paris and started her music career as an accordionist under the alias \"Rita Rella\" at the age of 13. In 1952, she was a pin-up model and took the name \"Rita Cadillac\" (clearly as an allusion to her prominent breasts) at Crazy Horse where she began to work as an exotic dancer. She was also a dancer of Folies Berg\u00e8re in the 1950s.\n\nCadillac appeared in many French films such as Soirs de Paris (1954), Porte oc\u00e9ane (1958), La prostitution (1962), Un clair de lune \u00e0 Maubeuge (1962), and Any Number Can Win (1963), becoming a renowned figure throughout Europe. In 1981, she appeared in the miniseries and film Das Boot, as the club singer Monique, in the town of La Rochelle.\n\nShe is the inspiration for Miss Rita Chevrolet, a recurring joke in the British satirical magazine Private Eye.\n\nSource: Article \"Rita Cadillac (French dancer)\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
