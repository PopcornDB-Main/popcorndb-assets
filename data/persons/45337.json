        "biography": "Leslie Ann Phillips\u00a0(born June 28, 1962), better known by her\u00a0stage name\u00a0Sam Phillips, is an American singer and songwriter. She is also an actress, best known for her film acting debut as the mute terrorist Katya in the\u00a0Bruce Willis\u00a0blockbuster\u00a0Die Hard with a Vengeance.\n\nPhillips made a cameo appearance in the 1997\u00a0Wim Wenders\u00a0film\u00a0The End of Violence, singing part of the song \"Animals on Wheels\" from\u00a0Omnipop.\n\nPhillips also began writing music for and scoring the TV series\u00a0Gilmore Girls, and appeared in the final episode of season six, performing \"Taking Pictures\" from her\u00a0Fan Dance\u00a0album. She also composed scores for the television shows Bunheads,\u00a0The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\n\nShe began her musical career in the early 1980s in the\u00a0contemporary Christian music industry, where she sang background vocals for\u00a0Christian\u00a0artists\u00a0Mark Heard\u00a0and\u00a0Randy Stonehill. Phillips was signed as a solo artist with\u00a0Myrrh Records under her given name and recorded four Christian pop albums:\u00a0Beyond Saturday Night,\u00a0Dancing with Danger,\u00a0Black and White in a Grey World\u00a0and,\u00a0The Turning.\u00a0The Turning\u00a0teamed her with producer\u00a0T Bone Burnett, whom she would later marry.\n\nSeveral of Phillips' songs became Top 10 singles on Christian radio and Myrrh records promoted her as \"the Christian Cyndi Lauper\". Phillips was never comfortable with this image, and it was a bone of contention between her and her label. She began using the name \"Sam\" professionally in 1988 when she left\u00a0Myrrh Records\u00a0and signed with\u00a0Virgin Records\u00a0in order to distance herself from her prior persona.\n\nWith\u00a0The Indescribable Wow, Philips moved into mainstream music. Cruel Inventions\u00a0was released in 1991, and included a guest performance by\u00a0Elvis Costello. 1994's\u00a0Martinis and Bikinis was nominated for a\u00a0Grammy Award, her second nomination.\n\nIn 1996, she released\u00a0Omnipop (It's Only a Flesh Wound Lambchop), which featured a song co-written by\u00a0R.E.M. After releasing a contractually obligated \"best of\" album in 1999, Virgin Records dropped Phillips from its roster. In 2001, she signed with Nonesuch Records, evolving her musical style to a stripped-down, acoustically based sound on her album called\u00a0Fan Dance\n\nIn 2004, she released\u00a0A Boot and a Shoe, another collection of acoustically based songs, similar in style to\u00a0Fan Dance. Her album\u00a0Don't Do Anything\u00a0was self-produced and released in 2008.\n\nIn October 2009, she launched\u00a0The Long Play, a music subscription service offering digital releases without a record label. The first subscription only EP, Hypnotists in Paris, was recorded with the\u00a0Section Quartet\u00a0and a Christmas collection\u00a0Cold Dark Night,\u00a0Magic for Everyone,\u00a0Old Tin Pan, and\u00a0Days of the One Night Stands\u00a0followed, with the full-length album\u00a0Cameras in the Sky\u00a0released in early 2010. In Spring 2011, she issued\u00a0Solid State, a public CD release.\n\nPush Any Button\u00a0was released on August 13, 2013. In 2013, her first live concert album,\u00a0Sam Phillips: Live @ Largo at The Coronet, was made available digitally through her website. In 2016, Phillips released a downloadable EP\u00a0Human Contact is Never Easy, which included four new tracks off her next album\u00a0World on Sticks. In September 2018, Phillips released\u00a0World on Sticks.",
