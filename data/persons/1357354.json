After high school he struck out on an adventure in South America where he lived on the coast learning Spanish and teaching English. A year away from finishing his degree in International Economics and Development, his University plays kicked him into the acting world. While shooting a short film in Toronto, he stopped by an agency unannounced, soaked with rain, without a resume and introduced himself. Three days after turning him down, the agency found his info and called him in to audition for a Feature film. Since then he has thrown himself headlong into acting and filmmaking.",
