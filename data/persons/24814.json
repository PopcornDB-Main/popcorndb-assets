        "biography": "Daniel Yves Alfred G\u00e9lin (19 May 1921 \u2013 29 November 2002) was a French actor.\n\nG\u00e9lin was born in Angers, Maine-et-Loire, the son of Yvonne (n\u00e9e Le M\u00e9ner) and Alfred Ernest Joseph G\u00e9lin.\n\nWhen he was ten, his family moved to Saint-Malo where Daniel went to college until he was expelled for 'uncouthness'. His father then found him a job in a shop that sold cans of salted cod. It was seeing the shooting of Marc All\u00e9gret's film Entr\u00e9e des artistes that triggered his desire to go to Paris to train to be an actor. He trained at the Cours Simon in Paris before entering the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique. There he met Louis Jouvet and embarked on a theatrical career. He made his first film appearance in 1940 in Miquette and for several years was an extra or played small roles in French films. He appeared with Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich in Martin Roumagnac (1946).\n\nHe won his first leading role in Rendez-vous de juillet (1949). From that time, he went on to appear in more than 150 films, including Max Oph\u00fcls' films La Ronde (1950) and Le Plaisir (1952), Jacques Becker's \u00c9douard et Caroline (1951), Sacha Guitry's films Si Versailles m'\u00e9tait cont\u00e9 (Royal Affairs in Versailles) (1954) and Napol\u00e9on (1955), Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Jean Cocteau's Le Testament d'Orph\u00e9e (1960), Le souffle au c\u0153ur (Murmur of the Heart) (1971), and La Nuit de Varennes (That Night in Varennes) (1982). He also wrote and directed one film, The Long Teeth, in 1952.\n\nG\u00e9lin was a leading man in French cinema during the 1950s, but his career declined with the coming of the New Wave. He worked in theater for several years, but later found new success on screen as a character actor. He appeared extensively in French films and television productions from the 1970s until his death, often playing cynical characters or grumpy old men.\n\nIn 1946, G\u00e9lin married actress Dani\u00e8le Delorme with whom he had a son, actor, director and producer Xavier G\u00e9lin. They divorced in 1954. While still married to Delorme, he had an affair with 17 year old model Marie Christine Schneider that produced a daughter, Maria Schneider. Due to his status as a married man, G\u00e9lin could not recognize Maria as his daughter. He visited the child several times but eventually severed his relationship with her mother. Maria Schneider and Daniel G\u00e9lin reconnected when she was sixteen and came to visit him. They remained in contact, although their relationship was irregular.\n\nG\u00e9lin was married to model Sylvie Hirsch from 1954 until their divorce in 1968. This marriage produced three children, Pascal (who died aged one year), Fiona , and Manuel, the latter two also becoming actors. In 1973, he remarried to Lydie Zaks with whom he had a daughter, Laura.\n\nG\u00e9lin died in Paris on 29 November 2002 of kidney failure.\n\nSource: Article \"Daniel G\u00e9lin\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
