        "biography": "Vincent Peter Jones\u00a0(born 5 January 1965) is a British actor, presenter, and former professional\u00a0footballer.\n\nJones played professionally as a defensive\u00a0midfielder\u00a0from 1984 to 1999, notably for\u00a0Wimbledon,\u00a0Leeds United,\u00a0Sheffield United,\u00a0Chelsea, and\u00a0Queens Park Rangers. He also played for and captained the\u00a0Welsh national team, having qualified through a Welsh grandparent. Best remembered for his time at Wimbledon as a pivotal member of the famous \"Crazy Gang\", he won the\u00a01988 FA Cup final\u00a0with the London side, a club for which he played over 200 games during two spells between 1986 and 1998. He played 184 games in the\u00a0Premier League, in which he scored 13 goals. Jones gained a reputation for being one of the hardest footballers in history, with his highly aggressive and physically uncompromising style of play, an image which has often led to him being\u00a0typecast in his film career as violent criminals and thugs.\n\nAs an actor, his film and television career began with\u00a0Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), for which he won an\u00a0Empire Award for Best Newcomer. Then, for\u00a0Snatch\u00a0(2000), he won the\u00a0Empire Award for Best British Actor. Other notable credits include\u00a0Gone in 60 Seconds (2000),\u00a0Mean Machine\u00a0(2001),\u00a0EuroTrip\u00a0(2004),\u00a0Extras\u00a0(2005),\u00a0X-Men: The Last Stand\u00a0(2006),\u00a0The Riddle\u00a0(2007),\u00a0The Midnight Meat Train (2008),\u00a0Year One\u00a0(2009),\u00a0The Cape\u00a0(2011),\u00a0Fire with Fire\u00a0(2012),\u00a0The Musketeers\u00a0(2014),\u00a0MacGyver\u00a0(2016),\u00a0NCIS: Los Angeles\u00a0(2019),\u00a0The Big Ugly\u00a0(2020) and\u00a0The Gentlemen\u00a0(2024).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Vinnie Jones, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
