He acted exclusively in French productions for the duration of his career with the exception of the Marlon Brando vehicle \"The Night of the Following Day\" in 1968, which was filmed in France. He also appeared in several international coproductions and low budget films by French exploitation director Jean Marie Pallardy, for which he is arguably best-known to contemporary audiences.",
