        "biography": "Christopher Brian Bridges\u00a0(born September 11, 1977), known professionally as\u00a0Ludacris(/\u02c8lu\u02d0d\u0259kr\u026as/, spoken as \"ludicrous\" in\u00a0American English), is an American rapper and actor. Born in\u00a0Champaign, Illinois, Ludacris moved to\u00a0Atlanta, Georgia, at age nine, where he first began rapping. Starting with a brief stint as a\u00a0DJ, he formed his record label,\u00a0Disturbing tha Peace, in the late 1990s to independently release his debut studio album\u00a0Incognegro\u00a0(1999). After its single, \"What's Your Fantasy\" (featuring\u00a0Shawnna), became a top 40 hit on the\u00a0Billboard Hot 100, the album was re-released by\u00a0Def Jam Recordings\u00a0as his major label debut,\u00a0Back for the First Time\u00a0(2000). The latter album peaked at number four on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0and spawned his second top 40 single, \"Southern Hospitality\" (featuring\u00a0Pharrell).\n\nLudacris' following albums,\u00a0Word of Mouf\u00a0(2001),\u00a0Chicken-n-Beer\u00a0(2003) and\u00a0The Red Light District(2004), were each met with continued success and received multi-platinum certifications by the\u00a0Recording Industry Association of America\u00a0(RIAA). His fifth and sixth albums,\u00a0Release Therapy\u00a0(2006) and\u00a0Theater of the Mind\u00a0(2008), explored more serious subject matter than its predecessors. His seventh album,\u00a0Battle of the Sexes\u00a0(2010), returned to the more lighthearted tone of his earlier albums. Throughout his career, Ludacris has scored two number-one singles on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100 as a lead artist: \"Stand Up\" (featuring Shawnna) and \"Money Maker\" (featuring Pharrell), as well as three singles which did so as a guest performer:\u00a0Usher's \"Yeah!\" in 2004,\u00a0Fergie's \"Glamorous\" in 2007, and\u00a0Taio Cruz's \"Break Your Heart\" in 2009. The following year, he guest featured on\u00a0Justin Bieber's single \"Baby\", one of the\u00a0highest-certified singles of all time in the United States.\n\nLudacris is cited as one of the first\u00a0Dirty South\u00a0rappers to achieve mainstream success in the early 2000s. He has received three\u00a0Grammy Awards: a\u00a0Screen Actors Guild Award, a\u00a0Critics' Choice Award, and an\u00a0MTV Video Music Award. Outside of music, he has portrayed Tej Parker\u00a0in the\u00a0Fast & Furious\u00a0film series\u2014first appearing in its second film,\u00a02 Fast 2 Furious\u00a0(2003). His other notable acting roles include\u00a0Crash\u00a0(2004),\u00a0Gamer\u00a0(2009), and\u00a0New Year's Eve\u00a0(2011). In 2021, he created and starred in the children's animated series\u00a0Karma's World\u00a0for\u00a0Netflix. Ludacris is also a\u00a0private pilot.",
