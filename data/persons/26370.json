        "biography": "Romain Bouteille (24 March 1937 \u2013 31 May 2021) was a French playwright, actor, comedian, and singer.\n\nRomain Bouteille is the author of nearly thirty plays of anarchist inspiration. In 1968, he met Coluche. Together, they founded the troupe Caf\u00e9 de la Gare. The same year, he separated from his partner Sotha who married Patrick Dewaere. Both are members of the troupe.\n\nBouteille was married to the actress Sa\u00efda Churchill, with whom he has lived for thirty years. After spending three years in Marseilles where their son Shams was born, in 1997, they settled in Beauce, in \u00c9tampes. In December 2014, together they created a fifty-seat theater, a sort of \u201cLeft Bank\u201d cabaret called Les Grands Solistes. About fifty artists, including Fran\u00e7ois Rollin, Albert Meslay, Clair Jaz, Didier Porte, Marc G\u00e9las, Fred Saurel, Paul Adam, Vincent Roca, Christophe Guybet, but also, in another register, Jean Vocat, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Huln\u00e9, Prune Lichtl\u00e9, have already happened there.\n\nSource: Article \"Romain Bouteille\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
