        "biography": "Sammo Hung Kam-Bo (Chinese: \u6d2a\u91d1\u5bf6, born Hung Kam-Bo, 7 January 1952) is a Hong Kong actor, martial artist, producer and director, known for his work in many kung fu films and Hong Kong action cinema. He has been a fight choreographer for, amongst others, Jackie Chan, King Hu, and John Woo. Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like Jiang Shi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. In East Asia, it is common for people to address their elders or influential people with familial nouns as a sign of familiarity and respect. Jackie Chan, for example, is often addressed as \"Dai Goh\", meaning Big Brother. Hung was also known as \"Dai Goh\", until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname \"Dai Goh Dai\", meaning, Big, Big Brother or Biggest Big Brother.\n\nWas a member of the\"Seven Little Fortunes\"  in Yu Jim-Yuen's China Drama Academy's Peking Opera School.",
