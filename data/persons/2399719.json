His father was a pastor and undoubtedly influenced David's desire to be in front of an audience. The acting bug took firm hold in junior high when David attended an acting workshop at a nearby university. Stage acting was a constant during high school and college years. He joined a small professional theatre company in Boston and also appeared in shows with the Harvard Drama Club and the Tufts University Summer Theatre. Later David attended Brandeis University where he gained an MFA and a well-rounded education in the dramatic arts, and studied playwriting with Israel Horovitz. After moving to Raleigh, North Carolina in the mid-80's, David has since worked steadily in film, TV, stage, industrials, and commercials.",
