He developed an early passion for VFX, self-teaching 3D animation from the age of 16, driven by a desire to insert fantastical elements into his own projects .\n\nHe spent his early twenties carving out a career in commercials and motion work, but gradually grew dissatisfied with the pace of progress toward his feature-film ambitions. In 2012, he made a bold career pivot, quitting commercial work to invest his own savings into crafting the trailer that would become Kung Fury .",
