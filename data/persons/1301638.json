        "biography": "Lee Charles was born in Birkenhead, Wirral in Merseyside, England. Martial Arts has always been a major factor of his life ever since he first saw a Bruce Lee movie. He began training at 6 years old, first in Shotkan Karate. Before discovering his love for the Martial Arts, Lee had always been very athletic. He was an outstanding football competitor and played for Everton, Tranmere and eventually signed with Wrexham. After suffering an injury however, Lee's contract was terminated. Continuing his training in the Martial Arts, Lee expanded his studies to other styles. He became a six-time World Kickboxing Champion. By 2005, he embarked on his journey to the United States to pursue a career in Hollywood. In West Hollywood, Los Angeles, Lee eventually met with one of his idols, the legendary kickboxer, martial artist, actor and choreographer Benny Urquidez. This meeting began Lee's true path to stardom. Through Benny \"The Jet\", Lee was invited to the Lee Strasburg Theatre and Film Institute. There, he began his formal training in acting and stunt work. He soon became a member of Benny's stunt team. Debuting in 2008, Lee has worked in films including Dracula Untold (2014), Viking Destiny (2018) and The Marine 6: Close Quarters (2018).",
