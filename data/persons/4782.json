        "biography": "John Michael Crichton\u00a0(/\u02c8kra\u026at\u0259n/; October 23, 1942 \u2013 November 4, 2008) was an American author, screenwriter and filmmaker. His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and over a dozen have been adapted into films. His literary works heavily feature technology and are usually within the\u00a0science fiction,\u00a0techno-thriller, and\u00a0medical fiction\u00a0genres. Crichton's novels often explore human technological advancement and attempted dominance over nature, both with frequently catastrophic results; many of his works are\u00a0cautionary tales, especially regarding themes of\u00a0biotechnology. Several of his stories centre on themes of\u00a0genetic modification,\u00a0hybridisation,\u00a0palaeontology\u00a0and/or\u00a0zoology. Many features have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflective of his medical training.\n\nCrichton received an\u00a0MD\u00a0from\u00a0Harvard Medical School\u00a0in 1969 but did not practice medicine, instead choosing to focus on his writing. Initially writing under a pseudonym, he eventually published 25 novels in his lifetime, including:\u00a0The Andromeda Strain\u00a0(1969),\u00a0The Terminal Man (1972),\u00a0The Great Train Robbery\u00a0(1975),\u00a0Congo (1980),\u00a0Sphere\u00a0(1987),\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0(1990),\u00a0Rising Sun\u00a0(1992),\u00a0Disclosure\u00a0(1994),\u00a0The Lost World\u00a0(1995),\u00a0Airframe\u00a0(1996),\u00a0Timeline\u00a0(1999),\u00a0Prey\u00a0(2002),\u00a0State of Fear\u00a0(2004), and\u00a0Next\u00a0(2006). Four more novels, in various stages of completion, were published after he died in 2008.\n\nCrichton was also involved in the film and television industry. In 1973, he wrote and directed\u00a0Westworld, the first film to use 2D\u00a0computer-generated imagery. He also directed\u00a0Coma\u00a0(1978),\u00a0The First Great Train Robbery\u00a0(1978),\u00a0Looker\u00a0(1981), and\u00a0Runaway\u00a0(1984). He was the creator of the television series\u00a0ER\u00a0(1994\u20132009), and several of his novels were adapted into films, most notably the\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0franchise.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Michael Crichton, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
