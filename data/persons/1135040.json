During the late 1950s, when the magazine \"Kamera\" created by Pamela and George Harrison Marks became hugely successful, Pamela would be busy finding and training other models to appear in the magazine. Later in her career, she would advise other models and actresses about using make-up, lighting, and costumes. She would often work behind the scenes with her life partner Doug Webb on British films and TV.",
