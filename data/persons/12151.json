        "biography": "Edward Montgomery \u201cMonty\u201d Clift was an American actor of the Golden Age, known for often playing sensitive or conflicted outcast characters with realistic emotional depth and anxieties.\n\nClift, Marlon Brando and James Dean are the trio typically associated with the new wave of film acting, with Clift being the oldest and first to make his stage and screen debuts. Starting at age 14, he was a breakout talent on Broadway throughout 1935-1945. He finally accepted one of many Hollywood offers: starring in the Western \u201cRed River\u201d which was filmed in 1946 but delayed release for 2 years. Fred Zinnemann\u2019s \u201cThe Search\u201d preceded \u201cRed River\u201d as his first film in 1948 and first Academy Award nomination. Clift\u2019s next major films were \u201cThe Heiress\u201d (1949) and \u201cA Place in the Sun\u201d (1951), cementing his romantic lead status. At the time, audiences had rarely seen a type of masculinity softened with Clift\u2019s vulnerability. Hollywood had also never seen a young actor control his career and instant stardom the way Clift did in the late 1940\u2019s: notoriously selective, refusing the standard seven-year studio contracts and rewriting scripts to preserve his artistic freedom. In 1953, Zinnemann again directed Clift to an Academy Award nomination in war drama \u201cFrom Here to Eternity.\u201d\n\nAfter suffering a near-fatal car accident during \u201cRaintree County\u201d (1957) he starred in acclaimed 1960\u2019s films \"Wild River,\u201d \"The Misfits\u201d and \u201cJudgment at Nuremberg\u201d for which he earned a fourth and final Academy Award nomination for his 12-minute scene. Despite a 4-year hiatus and mounting health problems, Clift was eager to make a comeback in \"Reflections in a Golden Eye,\u201d secured by the insurance and insistence of co-star Elizabeth Taylor, but he tragically died of a heart attack at the age of 45 just weeks before shooting began.",
