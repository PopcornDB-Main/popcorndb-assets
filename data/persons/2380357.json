He then won the 2015 GP3 Series with ART Grand Prix.\n\nA member of the Mercedes Junior Team from 2015 to 2019, Ocon made his Formula One debut at the 2016 Belgian Grand Prix with Manor, replacing Rio Haryanto for the remainder of the 2016 season.

He then spent three years racing in the KF3 category and competed in the Spanish Championship and Italian Open Masters. He won the French KF3 title in 2010 and finished as runner-up in the WSK Euro Series in 2011 behind Max Verstappen.\n\nAt the age of 14, Ocon was signed by Gravity Sports management, a sister company of Renault F1 team.\n\nIn 2012, Ocon made his debut in single-seaters, taking part in the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 with Koiranen Motorsport. He finished fourteenth with four point-scoring finishes, including being on the podium at his home round at Circuit Paul Ricard. He also contested a partial campaign in the Formula Renault 2.0 Alps with Koiranen, finishing seventh with two podiums, both of which came at the Red Bull Ring.\n\nHe remained in the series for 2013, switching to the ART Junior Team.
