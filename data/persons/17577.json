        "biography": "Pierre Cl\u00e9menti (28 September 1942 \u2013 27 December 1999) was a French actor.\n\nBorn in Paris, Cl\u00e9menti studied drama and began his acting career in the theatre. He secured his first minor screen roles in 1960 in Yves All\u00e9gret's Chien de pique performing alongside Eddie Constantine. Arguably, his most famous role was that of gangster lover of bourgeois prostitute Catherine Deneuve in Belle de jour, the 1967 classic by Luis Bu\u00f1uel, in whose film La voie lact\u00e9e he played the Devil. He appeared in several highly regarded films of the period, working with many of Europe's best known directors, including Luchino Visconti (The Leopard), Pier Paolo Pasolini (Pigsty) and Bernardo Bertolucci (The Conformist and Partner). Other directors he has worked with are Liliana Cavani, Glauber Rocha, Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3 and Philippe Garrel.\n\nIn 1972, his career was derailed after he was sentenced to prison for allegedly possessing or using drugs. Due to insufficient evidence, Cl\u00e9menti was released after 17 months; later he penned a book about his time in prison. After his release he played the role of ever-optimistic sailor of the Potemkin in Dusan Makavejev's scandalous movie Sweet movie, and the role of the seductive saxophone player Pablo in Fred Haines's film adaptation of Herman Hesse's novel Steppenwolf. Throughout his career, he continued to be active on-stage.\n\nHe was also involved with the French underground film movement, directing several of his own films, which often featured fellow underground filmmakers and actors. Visa de censure no X was an experimental work made up of two of films. New Old was a feature length work released in 1978 in which Viva appeared. La Revolution ce ne'est qu'un debut, continuons le combat, followed by In the shadow of the blue rascal and Sun. He died of liver cancer in 1999\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Pierre Cl\u00e9menti, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",
