He said, \"I realised when I started Sin City that I found American and English comics to be too wordy, too constipated, and Japanese comics to be too empty. So I was attempting to do a hybrid.\" Miller has received every major comic book industry award, and in 2015 he was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.\n\nMiller's feature film work includes writing the scripts for the 1990s science fiction films RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3, sharing directing duties with Robert Rodriguez on Sin City and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, producing the film 300, and directing the film adaptation of The Spirit. Sin City earned a Palme d'Or nomination.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Frank Miller,\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
