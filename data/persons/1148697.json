        "biography": "Adam Hurtig was born in August of 1985, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. His interest in performing sparked in High School, after being thrust into a musical by a long-time family friend and drama teacher. From there he continued his pursuit for the craft in a post-secondary education from the University of Manitoba.  Although this was a short-lived endeavor, the seed was firmly planted. This brought him to a more individual exploration of performance until ultimately landing in his current passion of film and television. Since then,  Adam has appeared in a number of roles such as Flag Day (2021) with Sean Penn, the horror franchise, Chucky, in both Curse of Chucky (2013) and Cult of Chucky (2017), The Ice Road (2021) with Liam Neeson, a wide range of romantic comedies, action, and horror movies, and now most recently Spencer Sisters (2023 - TV Series).\n\nWhen not performing, Adam has a wide range of hobbies and enjoys interior design, carpentry, gardening, writing, and coaching budding actors for film and television.",
