Her body was supposedly split down the middle, one side female and the other male. She claimed to be an intersex person (\"true hermaphrodite\" as it was called in her times), but there is no evidence to confirm whether this was the case; she may have just been a very skilled impersonator, in the style of Albert-Alberta Karas.
