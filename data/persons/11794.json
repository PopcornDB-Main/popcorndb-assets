        "biography": "Frances Evelyn Bay (n\u00e9e Goffman; January 23, 1919 \u2013 September 15, 2011) was a Canadian-American character actress known for playing a variety of quirky elderly women on film and television.  In a career that spanned 35 years, she acted in a variety of roles both in film and television. After initial success in radio and stage plays, she became \"The Girlfriend to the Canadian Forces\" on CBC Radio during World War II, boosting troops' spirits. Marriage and a move to the U.S. led to a hiatus, during which she studied acting with Uta Hagen in New York. Returning to acting at 60, Bay featured in Foul Play and gained recognition in various TV shows like Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, and films such as The Wedding Planner and Twins. Her versatile career spanned over 50 films and numerous TV series, earning her awards and nominations. Notably, she appeared in the final episodes of sitcoms Seinfeld, Who\u2019s the Boss?, and Happy Days. Bay was inducted in Canada's Walk of Fame in 2008.",
