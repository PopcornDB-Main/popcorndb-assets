        "biography": "Dorothy Parker (n\u00e9e Rothschild; August 22, 1893 \u2013 June 7, 1967) was an American poet, writer, critic, and satirist based in New York; she was known for her wit, wisecracks, and eye for 20th-century urban foibles.\n\nFrom a conflicted and unhappy childhood, Parker rose to acclaim, both for her literary works published in magazines, such as The New Yorker, and as a founding member of the Algonquin Round Table. Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting. Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics resulted in her being placed on the Hollywood blacklist.\n\nDismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a \"wisecracker.\" Nevertheless, both her literary output and reputation for sharp wit have endured. Some of her works have been set to music; adaptations included the operatic song cycle Hate Songs by composer Marcus Paus.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Dorothy Parker, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
