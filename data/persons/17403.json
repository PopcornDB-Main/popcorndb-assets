He graduated from the\u00a0University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics.\u00a0After losing interest in a career in science, Judge focused on animation and short films. His animated short\u00a0Frog Baseball was developed into the successful\u00a0MTV\u00a0series\u00a0Beavis and Butt-Head and the spin-off series\u00a0Daria\u00a0(with which Judge had no involvement).\n\nIn 1995, Judge and former\u00a0Simpsons\u00a0writer\u00a0Greg Daniels\u00a0developed\u00a0King of the Hill, which debuted on\u00a0Fox\u00a0in 1997 and quickly became popular with critics and audiences.
