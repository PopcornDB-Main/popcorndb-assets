        "biography": "Daniel Henney was born in\u00a0Carson City, Michigan, to a Korean adoptee mother\u00a0and Philip Henney, his American father of Irish descent.\u00a0Daniel Henney started modeling in the U.S. in 2001 and worked in\u00a0France,\u00a0Italy,\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0and\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0while attending college. After his debut in\u00a0South Korea\u00a0with an advertisement for the\u00a0Amore Pacific's cosmetic \"Odyssey Sunrise\", he became a spokesperson for commercials with\u00a0Jun Ji-hyun\u00a0for\u00a0Olympus\u00a0cameras and\u00a0Kim Tae-hee\u00a0for Daewoo Electronics's Klasse air conditioners. Despite speaking no\u00a0Korean,\u00a0Henney became a household name through the South Korean hit TV drama,\u00a0My Lovely Sam Soon, aka My Name is Kim Sam Soon. He played the role of Dr. Henry Kim, a surgeon who is devotedly in love with Hee-jin (played by\u00a0Jung Ryeo-won). Sam Soon was the most popular Korean drama in 2005; although Henney was starring as the supporting actor, his performance and look was widely noticed. Henney then starred in another drama \u201cSpring Waltz\u201d in 2006. He later learned the language and appeared on a few variety shows, such as\u00a0Family Outing.\u00a0Henney was a part of an academic scandal in which many sources stated that he had an Economics degree from the University of Illinois at\u00a0Chicago, while in actuality he had no college degree. Henney starred in his first feature film in Korea, \"Seducing Mr. Perfect.\" His second film, \"My Father,\" won multiple awards in South Korea and was actually the first time in that country's history that a foreigner swept all the major cinema awards in the Best New Actor category. In 2009, he portrayed\u00a0Agent Zero\u00a0in the film\u00a0X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In the fall season of 2009, he played \"Dr. David Lee\" in the\u00a0CBS\u00a0television drama\u00a0Three Rivers. In 2010, Henney returned to\u00a0South Korea\u00a0television for\u00a0KBS2's\u00a0The Fugitive: Plan B, alongside\u00a0Rain\u00a0and actress\u00a0Lee Na-young. Henney is signed with\u00a0DNA Models\u00a0in New York under the celebrity-division.",
