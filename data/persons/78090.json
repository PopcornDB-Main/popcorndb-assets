        "biography": "Dee Pollock was born on September 24, 1937 in Alhambra, California, USA. He was an actor and producer, known for Kelly's Heroes (1970), The Wayward Bus (1957) and The Outer Limits (1963). He died on December 27, 2005 in Chico, California.\n\nIn 1989, Pollock moved from southern California up to Chico to care for his mother. In his later years, he had given up acting and become involved in a Hindu religion based on the Babaji, an ancient figure cast as the Yogi-Christ of Modern India. Pollock often went to Kauai to fellowship with a group of Babaji followers and was regarded highly in the spiritual order so much that news of his death was noted by the Dalai Lama in Tibet, who asked for prayers in his memory. His body was cremated on Kauai and his ashes scattered in a river on the island.  CLR",
