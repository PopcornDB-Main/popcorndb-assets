He was in many films including In the Good Old Summertime, Lullaby of Broadway, Christmas in Connecticut and Casablanca in which he played Carl, the head waiter.\n\nChubby-jowled Sakall played numerous supporting roles in Hollywood musicals and comedies in the 1940s and 1950s. His rotund cuteness earned Sakall the nickname \"Cuddles,\" and he was often billed as S.Z. \"Cuddles\" Sakall in his later films, though he was never happy with the name. He was famous for using the phrase \"everything is hunky dunky.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article S. Z. Sakall, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
