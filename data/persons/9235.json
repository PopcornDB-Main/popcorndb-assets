Her first film was with Benigni in 1983, the comedy Tu Mi Turbi (\"You Upset Me\"). She later appeared in two Jim Jarmusch films, Down by Law and Mystery Train.\n\nBraschi's two most successful collaborations with her husband have been Johnny Stecchino (1992) and La Vita \u00e8 Bella (Life is Beautiful) (1997). The first, an Italian comedy that cast the actress as the girlfriend of a mobster (Benigni), was a huge hit in Italy; while the second, in which Braschi played the wife of an Italian Jew (Benigni) imprisoned in a concentration camp, was a widely-praised success that launched both Braschi and her husband into the international spotlight.\n\nShe was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award as a cast member of Life is Beautiful. She is also a David di Donatello award winner (Italy's equivalent of the Oscars).\n\nIn 2002, she was a member of the jury at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nIn 2010 she has returned to theatre starring in \"Tradimenti\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Nicoletta Braschi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
