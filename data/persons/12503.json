        "biography": "Brown had major roles in several popular radio shows: He was \"John Doe\" in the Texaco Star Theater's version of Fred Allen's Allen's Alley,[2] played Irma's love interest Al in My Friend Irma, both \"Gillis\" and Digby \"Digger\" O'Dell in The Life of Riley, (a role he reprised for the first incarnation of the television show), \"Broadway\" in The Damon Runyon Theatre, and \"Thorny\" the neighbor on the radio version of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Perhaps his most memorable piece of work is the \u2018Broadway\u2019 role; once heard, many find it impossible to think of the narrator of Damon Runyon\u2019s stories as anyone else. It was a measure of Brown\u2019s talent that this quintessentially American character was portrayed by an Englishman.\n\nBrown appeared in some notable films: as the inebriated professor in Hitchcock\u2019s Strangers on a Train (1951), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951, uncredited), and The Wild One (1953); he supplied the voice of \"Ro-Man\" in the 1953 cult science fiction B-film Robot Monster.",
