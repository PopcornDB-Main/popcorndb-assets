Bloom had an early interest in acting, including appearing in several commercials as a child, but made his big break in the Sergio Leone\u00a0film\u00a0Once Upon a Time in America. From there, he was offered the role of\u00a0Dusty Donovan\u00a0in the hit soap opera\u00a0As the World Turns, which he played for several years. During that run, Bloom became the youngest winner of a\u00a0Daytime Emmy Award\u00a0in the category of\u00a0Outstanding Young Leading Man\u00a0during the\u00a012th Daytime Emmy Awards\u00a0show for his performance on the series.
