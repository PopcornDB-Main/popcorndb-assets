This led to a contract with MGM and roles in such films as Mata Hari (1931), Scarface (1932), The Phantom of Crestwood (1932), The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), Arsene Lupin (1933) and Dinner at Eight (1933).\n\nIn 1934, Morley left MGM after arguments about her roles and her private life. Her first film after leaving MGM was Our Daily Bread (1934) directed by King Vidor. She continued to work as a freelance performer, and appeared in Michael Curtiz's Black Fury, and The Littlest Rebel with Shirley Temple. Without the support of a studio, her roles became less frequent, however she played a supporting role in Pride and Prejudice (1940).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Karen Morley\u00a0\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
