        "biography": "Andr\u00e9 Robert Raimbourg (27 July 1917 \u2013 23 September 1970), better known as Andr\u00e9 Bourvil, and mononymously as Bourvil, was a French actor and singer best known for his roles in comedy films, most notably in his collaboration with Louis de Fun\u00e8s in the films Le Corniaud (1965) and La Grande Vadrouille (1966). For his performance in Le Corniaud, he won a Special Diploma at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nBourvil's father was killed in the First World War before he was born. As a result, he spent his entire childhood in the village of Bourville, from which he took his stage name. He married Jeanne Lefrique on 23 January 1943. After a battle with Kahler's syndrome, which attacks the bone marrow, he died at the age of 53. He is buried in Montainville, Yvelines.\n\nIn his comic performances Bourvil principally played roles of gentle and well-meaning characters who were often a bit obtuse or na\u00efve, such as his roles opposite the hyperactive, dishonest and bossy ones played by Louis de Fun\u00e8s. Bourvil's characters not only managed to make viewers laugh, but also to save themselves, often unwittingly, from the Machiavellian designs of his adversaries.\n\nBourvil was, however, also capable of more dramatic roles such as the handyman in L'Arbre de No\u00ebl (1969). In this role he observes the relationship between a man he works for and the young son who has fallen ill. The audience can identify with the character played by Bourvil, just as they can in his comic roles, so often as a simple man. One can also note his role of Monsieur Th\u00e9nardier in the film adaptation of Les Mis\u00e9rables (1958), and his penultimate role as the policeman Mattei in Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle rouge (1970).\n\nIn March 1948, Bourvil took part in the complete recording of Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann with artists of the Paris Op\u00e9ra-Comique conducted by Andr\u00e9 Cluytens, playing the four 'servant' roles.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bourvil, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
