At an early age she started designing doll clothes, mixing makeup colors, styling hair, lip syncing to her favorite songs on camera and creating story lines with her dolls and imaginary friends. Growing up as an only child gave her an enormous amount of room for creativity. After graduating high school she studied at several trade schools which led her to open her own business which was a fashion, beauty and entertainment company. She used her skills to design, cut hair, apply makeup, host events, work as a television production crew member and now an actress that has become Christina Alex. She is aware of what she wants in life in terms of her career direction. Christina is a trained improv actress, that is enjoys networking and learning.
