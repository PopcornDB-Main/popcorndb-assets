She made a small appearance in the film Home Alone as a girl in the airport, and provided the voice of Katie McClary in the animated series Wish Kid throughout its run in 1991. In 1993, she appeared alongside her big brother, Macaulay, in the film The Good Son. It doesn\u2019t appear that she\u2019s acted in film or TV since that time, per IMDb. Similar to her brother Shane, she has shied away from the spotlight and little is known about her whereabouts.",
