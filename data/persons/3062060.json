        "biography": "The German actor Kjell Brutscheidt was born on 23rd April 1996, in Dusseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, and is known for his performances in \u201cSpreewaldkrimi\u201d, \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d, and \u201cIch bin Sophie Scholl\u201d.\n\nThe thespian perfected his craft at the August Everding Theater Academy in Munich, and appeared in a number of stage productions in Berlin and Munich, performing at prestigious venues such as the Opernhaus Zurich and Schauspielhaus D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nIn the 2019/20 season, Kjell was part of the Theater Bielefeld\u2019s first interdisciplinary studio. The following year, the actor debuted in front of cameras with two projects: \u201cSpreewaldkrimi\u201d and the popular Instagram series \u201cI am Sophie Scholl\u201d.\n\n2022 saw Kjell explore a variety of genres, from crime shows (\u201cPolice Call 110\u201d, \u201cZeit der Abrechnung\u201d) to historical movies (\u201cDer junge Hauptling Winnetou\u201d). The German also guest-starred in episodes of \u201cIn aller Freundschaft\u201d, \u201cSarah Kohr\u201d, and \u201cMorden im Norden\u201d.\n\nIn 2022, he landed his biggest role to date with his casting as Tanner in \u201cThe Hunger Games: A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d, which is the fifth movie in the \u201cHunger Games\u201d franchise, but serves as the prequel. The dystopian action movie, which was filmed with an extravagant $100 million budget, has a November 2023 theatrical release date in the US, and is on track to earn $50 million in its opening weekend.\n\nAlthough Kjell has less than two thousand Instagram followers at the time of writing, this is likely to change when \u201cA Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d premieres in cinemas. The actor is known to engage with his fans by replying to their comments, and enjoys sharing glimpses of his day-to-day life, be it a night out with friends or an important industry event.\n\nKjell\u2019s distinctive physical appearance has been a topic of discussion recently, as the \u201cBallad of Songbirds and Snakes\u201d cast attended the world premiere of the movie in early November 2023. The actor appears to have some sort of eye condition, as he is unable to open his left eye; however, he\u2019s never discussed the subject in interviews or via social media, but may well share the story behind his eye in the future.\n\nFor now, Kjell\u2019s net worth is approximately $250,000. His height is listed as 5ft 8in (172cm).",
