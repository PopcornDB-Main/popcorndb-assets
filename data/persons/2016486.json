        "biography": "Troy Michael Andrews was a 4-year-old boy when he first-handed a trombone. That young player emulated the musicians he heard playing in the \u201csecond line\u201d parades, most notably his older brother James, a skilled performer in his own right. Young Troy was so small, and his instrument was twice his size, that he earned the nickname \u201cTrombone Shorty\u201d. Over the years, he listened attentively to his elders who educated him on the New Orlean\u2019s deeply-rooted musical traditions. His capable hands absorbed these lessons, and he practiced constantly. A band-leader at age 8 and touring musician at 10, Trombone Shorty\u2019s horn became his passport that opened the doors to the world.\n\nRespectful of and inspired by the music\u2019s history, Troy developed a foundation built upon the many musical traditions of his hometown (jazz, gospel, and R&B), and updated them with modern rock and hip-hop influences. In doing so, he has created his own style, one he calls \u201cSupaFunkRock\u201d.",
