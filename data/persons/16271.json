        "biography": "William Squire\u00a0(29 April 1917\u00a0\u2013 3 May 1989) was a Welsh actor of stage, film and television.  Squire was born in\u00a0Neath,\u00a0South Wales, the son of William Squire and his wife Martha (n\u00e9e Bridgeman).  As a stage actor, Squire performed at\u00a0Stratford-upon-Avon\u00a0and at the Old Vic, and notably replaced his fellow-countryman\u00a0Richard Burton\u00a0as King Arthur in\u00a0Camelot\u00a0at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway. One of his first film appearances was in the 1956 film\u00a0Alexander the Great, which starred Burton in the title role.  His varied screen roles included\u00a0Thomas More\u00a0in the 1969 film version of\u00a0Maxwell Anderson's play\u00a0Anne of the Thousand Days, Sir Daniel Brackley in the 1972 television adaptation of\u00a0Robert Louis Stevenson's\u00a0The Black Arrow, the voice of\u00a0Gandalf\u00a0in the 1978 animated version of\u00a0The Lord of the Rings\u00a0and the\u00a0Shadow\u00a0in the 1979\u00a0Doctor Whoserial\u00a0The Armageddon Factor. Perhaps his best-known role was as Hunter, the superior of secret agent David Callan in the spy series\u00a0Callan\u00a0in the early 1970s; Squire took over the role from\u00a0Derek Bond.  In a set of\u00a0Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica-produced educational films about\u00a0William Shakespeare's\u00a0Macbeth, Squire played the role of Macbeth. This was in keeping with his long career as a Shakespearean actor, which included roles in the classic 1960s TV series,\u00a0An Age of Kings.",
