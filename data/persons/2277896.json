She tried most sports and fell in love with aerial pole at the age of 17 as it combined both gymnastic agility and dance movement. She went on to perform and compete professionally in major pole competitions. Lucy was always extremely disciplined and her love for training hard and learning new skills, eventually pushed her in the direction of the Stunt Industry. Here she could utilise her strong performance background along with her martial arts and gymnastics training. It took her 3 years to complete her remaining stunt disciplines and soon after qualifying, she was lucky enough to get an audition for Mission Impossible 'Rogue Nation' with the legendary 2nd Unit Director & Stunt Coordinator, Wade Eastwood. She was made part of the core stunt team as has continued to work on major feature films including, Inferno, Jack Reacher 'Never Go Back', Assassin's Creed, The Mummy, Mission Impossible 6 and more! Lucy still continues to train hard in order to keep up her existing skills and learn new ones, so she can add to any team!",
