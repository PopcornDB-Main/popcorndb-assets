Until the late 90s she was still employed at her \"day Job\" as a Correction Officer at NYC's Rikers Island. Initially a backup session singer, she impressed Record Executives and - Producers Gabriel Roth and Philip Lehman, when she was the only one to show up for a recording session, and demonstrated her ability to sing on several different backup tracks. \"Sharon Jones and The Dap Kings\" were formed In 2002. They were comprised of Sharon Jones backed by members from three bands.From \"The Soul Providers\", Bosco Mann on bass, guitarist Binky Griptite, percussionist Fernando Velez, trumpet player Anda Szilagyi and organist Earl Maxton. They were joined by \"The Mighty Imperials\"s saxophonist Leon Michels and drummer Homer Steinweiss plus Neal Sugarman from \"Sugarman 3\". As \"Sharon Jones and The Dap Kings\", the band has released several critically acclaimed albums including \"Naturally\" (2005) and \"I Learned the Hard Way (2010).
