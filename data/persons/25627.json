Smith is best known as Otis Campbell, the town drunk on The Andy Griffith Show, and was the voice of many characters on various animated cartoon shorts. He is also known to radio listeners as John Avery Whittaker on Adventures in Odyssey.\n\nSmith is often wrongly given credit for the writing of the movie It Came from Beneath the Sea, as well as ten other produced feature films. The true co-writer of those movies is Harold Jacob Smith, who wrote as \"Hal Smith\" until 1958.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Hal Smith (actor),\u00a0\u00a0licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
