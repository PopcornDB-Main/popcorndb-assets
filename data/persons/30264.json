He majored in acting while attending the University of Madrid.

In New York, he acted on both stage and screen. His first motion picture performance was in the 1915 Jewish drama, Children of the Ghetto. On the stage, he appeared in more than a dozen Broadway plays between 1915 and 1928, including 39 East, Dreams for Sale and the original production of What Price Glory? in 1924\u20131925.
