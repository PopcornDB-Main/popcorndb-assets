        "biography": "Aileen Wu, is a Chinese-American actor, director, writer, producer currently based in Brooklyn, NY and Vancouver, BC.  Throughout her teenage immigration experience, Aileen used creative storytelling as a tool to unpack the mysteries of cultural relativism. And lately, each project has been an opportunity to challenge the confines of communication and empathy.  Aileen made her off-broadway acting debut in 2019 as Cordelia in Smith Street Stage\u2019s new adaptation, LEAR: THAT OLD MAN I USED TO KNOW. In the following year, she made her directing debut through NYU\u2019s Chinese Students & Scholars Association with her new play, THE POEM OF FORGETFULNESS, using a devised and experimental theatre approach.  Recent producing credits include theatre documentary, HAMLET: REHEARSED (for Smith Street Stage), narrative short-film, FISH TANK (for the 2021 Run N\u2019 Gun 48 Hr Filmmaking Competition) and award winning ultra-short-film CLOSING DOORS (for the 16th Annual Mighty Asian Moviemaking Marathon at the Vancouver Asian Film Festival).",
