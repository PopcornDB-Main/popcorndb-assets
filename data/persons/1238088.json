        "biography": "Jane Luk, a Canadian actress rooted in Toronto for over three decades, honed her craft through formal training at Humber Theatre. Notably, she crafted a satirical mock infomercial titled \"How to Be More Chinese,\" aiming to humorously address media stereotypes by altering DNA to evoke one's inner Chinese identity. Initially performed live at events and festivals, Luk adapted it into a short film, later acquired by the Comedy Network, where it aired for two successful years. This creative venture remains a standout highlight in her career, showcasing her ability to tackle societal issues with humour and wit.",
