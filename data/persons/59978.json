Wright co-wrote the 1998 film \u201cThe Siege,\u201d which depicts events eerily similar to those occurring in the U.S. after 9/11. In 2006, his one-man play \u201cMy Trip to al-Qaeda,\u201d based on the book, enjoyed a sold-out, six-week run in Soho. Wright is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.",
