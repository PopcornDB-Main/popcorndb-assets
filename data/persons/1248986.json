        "biography": "Erin Brockovich (n\u00e9e Pattee; born June 22, 1960) is an American legal clerk, whistleblower, consumer advocate, and environmental activist who, despite her lack of education in the law, was instrumental in building a case against Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) involving groundwater contamination in Hinkley, California with the help of attorney Ed Masry in 1993. Their successful lawsuit was the subject of the Oscar-winning film, Erin Brockovich (2000), starring Julia Roberts as Brockovich and Albert Finney as Masry. Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality as well, hosting the TV series Challenge America with Erin Brockovich on ABC and Final Justice on Zone Reality. She is the president of Brockovich Research & Consulting. She also works as a consultant for the New York law firm of Weitz & Luxenberg,[1] which has a focus on personal injury claims for asbestos exposure, and Shine Lawyers in Australia.[2] She worked as a consultant for the now-defunct California law firm Girardi & Keese.[3][4]\n\nFrom Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia",
