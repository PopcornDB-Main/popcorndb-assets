He appeared in more than 220 films between 1920 and 1943, mostly in small supporting roles.  Spencer Charters first stage work soon after leaving school was a walk on part, but it wasn't long before he was being given fair-sized roles. He played on Broadway between 1910 and 1929 and was a busy character actor in films during the 1930s and early 1940s. He often portrayed somewhat befuddeled judges, doctors, clerks, managers, and jailers.\n\nHe died by suicide from a mix of sleeping pills and carbon monoxide poisoning.",
