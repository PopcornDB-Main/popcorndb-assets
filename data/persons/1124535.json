        "biography": "Kazama Shunsuke is a Japanese actor, entertainer, voice actor, and presenter born in Sumida, Tokyo, Japan. After leaving SMILE-UP, he has been active as a freelancer.\n\nKazama's interest in television dramas led him to audition for Johnny & Associates in 1997, during his second year of junior high school, at the encouragement of his family. He debuted that same year with the group Shonentai and continued as a Johnny's Jr. He also worked as a backup dancer for groups like TOKIO and V6. Despite joining B.I.G. in September 1998, a hiatus due to high school exams led to a shift in his role within the agency.\n\nIn 2000, Kazama ventured into voice acting, debuting in the TV anime \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters\".\n\nIn early May 2013, Kazama married a non-celebrity woman, with the announcement made through Johnny & Associates in July of that year.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, a dedicated page for Kazama was established on the Johnny & Associates official website, signifying his departure from Johnny's Jr.\n\nOn February 11, 2019, reports surfaced of Kazama's wife giving birth to their first son.\n\nOn December 16, 2023, SMILE-UP's official website announced Kazama's intention to become independent by the end of that month. He subsequently established his own personal agency and now holds the title of \"representative director\".",
