        "biography": "Alan Walbridge Ladd\u00a0was an American actor and film and television producer. Ladd found success in film the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in\u00a0Westerns\u00a0and\u00a0film noirs\u00a0where he was often paired with\u00a0Veronica Lake, as she was one of the few Hollywood actresses shorter than he. His popularity diminished in the late 1950s, though he continued to appear in popular films until his death from\u00a0cerebral edema\u00a0in January 1964.\n\nLadd was born in\u00a0Hot Springs, Arkansas, but later relocated to North Hollywood, California when his mother re-married. \u00a0\u00a0He worked briefly as a studio carpenter (as did his stepfather) and for a short time was part of the\u00a0Universal Pictures\u00a0studio school for actors. \u00a0Intent on acting, he found work in small theatres.\u00a0He had short term stints at MGM and RKO, and eventually started getting steady work on radio. \u00a0Ladd began by appearing in dozens of films in small roles, including\u00a0Citizen Kane\u00a0, before reaching recognition for his 1942 appearance in This Gun for Hire,\u00a0invigorating Hollywood's desire for gangster-crime features. \u00a0His cool, unsmiling persona proved popular with wartime audiences, and he was quickly established as one of the top box office stars of the decade.",
