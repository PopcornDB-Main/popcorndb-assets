        "biography": "Janet Gaynor (October 6, 1906 \u2013 September 14, 1984) was an American actress and painter.\n\nOne of the most popular actresses of the silent film era, in 1928 Gaynor became the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in three films: Seventh Heaven (1927), Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) and Street Angel (1928). This was the only occasion on which an actress has won for multiple roles. This rule would be changed three years later by AMPAS. Her career continued with the advent of sound film, and she achieved a notable success in the original version of A Star Is Born (1937).\n\nShe worked only sporadically after the late 1930s. Severely injured in a 1982 vehicle collision, the incident contributed to her death two years later.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Janet Gaynor, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
