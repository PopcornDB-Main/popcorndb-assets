After a season of rugby at the university, he tried his hand at stand-up comedy at the urging of his roommates. A 10-year career touring the country followed (where his ability to do voices came in handy), punctuated by the occasional TV appearance on Nickelodeon. He relocated to Orlando in his early 20s and then later, he relocated to Los Angeles. Edgerly has since settled into the world of voiceover, in which he provides voices for movies, TV shows, and video games, and he still does the occasional stand-up gig around town.",
