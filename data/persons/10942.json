Apart from his film activity, Pat ran a gymnasium in Birmingham, operated a used appliance business in the local markets and was known as a warm-hearted and genial man who was happy to chat with admiring fanatics, sign autographs and pose for photographs.\n\nRoach was also very popular with English television audiences for his portrayal of gentle giant \"Brian 'Bomber' Busbridge\" in the series\u00a0Auf Wiedersehen, Pet (1983) and was scheduled to appear in the fifth series of the show, when he died of cancer on July 17, 2004.
