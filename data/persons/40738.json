        "biography": "Wolfgang Stegemann is a stunt coordinator, fight choreographer, and second-unit director. Stegemann was born on March 16, 1974, in Berlin, Germany. Standing at 1.89\u202fm (6\u202fft\u202f2\u00bd\u202fin), his early work encompassed roles as a stunt performer, rigging coordinator, and fight choreographer, with credits on international productions like\u00a0Don \u2013 The King Is Back\u00a0(2011),\u00a0Ninja Assassin\u00a0(2009),\u00a0V for Vendetta\u00a0(2005), and\u00a0Edge of Tomorrow (2014). As he built his reputation in the stunt community, his fluency in both German and English, combined with his expertise in wire work, high falls, martial arts, precision driving, and fire stunts, made him a sought-after coordinator and fight director.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, Stegemann had transitioned into second-unit direction and stunt coordination on high-profile Hollywood productions. Notably, he served as fight choreographer, utility stunt performer, and stunt/rigger coordinator on\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation\u00a0(2015), went on to contribute to\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u00a0(2018), coordinated fights for\u00a0Men in Black: International\u00a0and\u00a0Jumanji: The Next Level\u00a0(2019), and was involved in\u00a0The Mummy\u00a0(2017). His fight and stunt expertise also extended to\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0(2014),\u00a0Victoria\u00a0(2015, for which he was second-unit director and stunt coordinator), and\u00a0Luther \u2013 The Fallen Sun\u00a0and\u00a0The Witcher\u00a0Season\u202f3 in 2022\u20132023.\n\nThroughout his career, Stegemann has been recognised by his peers for his contributions to action filmmaking. He earned nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble for\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation\u00a0(2016) and\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u00a0(2019), winning the same award in 2024 for\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One, reflecting his long-standing collaboration on the franchise. At the Taurus World Stunt Awards, he was nominated for\u00a0Don 2\u00a0(2012) and\u00a0The Mummy\u00a0(2018), and notably won Best Stunt Rigging for\u00a0Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u00a0in 2019.\n\nIn addition to industry accolades, Stegemann received the Webby Award in 2024 for \"People's Voice \u2013 Viral\" for his immersive work as a second-unit director on\u00a0The Witcher\u00a0Season\u202f3. His directorial prowess in shorter forms was celebrated in 2023 when he won Best Director for an Action Short Film at the Best Film Awards and received a nomination for Best Male Director at the Cannes World Film Festival, both for\u00a0\"Andrea Alive.\"\n\nStegemann's directorial short film, Limitless, garnered multiple wins in 2025, including Best Director and Best Short Film at the Dubai International Cine Carnival Film Festival, a Certificate of Achievement at the Berlin Motion Picture Awards, and Outstanding Achievement in both Best Director and Short Film at the Swedish Academy of Motion Picture Awards. Outside the spotlight, he maintains a robust international career, often working and based in Berlin with ties to global production hubs\u2014including London, Los Angeles, and across Europe and North America\u2014and holds memberships in the Directors Guild of America, Equity UK, Screen Actors Guild, the Taurus World Stunt Academy, and more.",
