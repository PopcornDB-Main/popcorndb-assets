        "biography": "Glynis Johns (October 5, 1923 - January 4, 2024) was a South African-born British actress, dancer, musician and singer. Born in Pretoria, South Africa, while her parents were on tour, she is best known for originating the role of Desiree Armfeldt in A Little Night Music on Broadway, for which she won a Tony Award, and for playing Winifred Banks in Walt Disney's musical motion picture Mary Poppins. In 2020, with the death of Olivia de Havilland, Johns became the oldest living Academy Award-nominee in any acting category.\n\nIn both roles, Johns sang songs written specifically for her, including \"Send in the Clowns\", composed by Stephen Sondheim, and \"Sister Suffragette\", written by the Sherman Brothers.\n\nJohns was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the 1960 film The Sundowners. She was one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood and class years of British cinema. She is known for the breathy quality of her husky voice and her upbeat persona.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Glynis Johns, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
