Unemployed, and with no family, he hopes to find a place to commit seppuku\u2014and a worthy second to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce in his suicide ritual. The senior counselor for the Iyi clan questions the ronin\u2019s resolve and integrity, suspecting Hanshir\u014d of seeking charity rather than an honorable end. What follows is a pair of interlocking stories which lay bare the difference between honor and respect, and promises to examine the legendary foundations of the Samurai code.",
