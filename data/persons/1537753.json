Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton tells the true story of how these cultural rebels\u2014armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and raw talent\u2014stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world\u2019s most dangerous group, N.W.A.  And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today.",
