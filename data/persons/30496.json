        "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nFrancis Ford (born Francis Feeney, August 14, 1881 \u2013 September 5, 1953) was a prolific film actor, writer, and director. He was the mentor and elder brother of film director John Ford. He also appeared in many of John Ford's movies, including Young Mr. Lincoln and The Quiet Man.\n\nFrancis Ford was born in Portland, Maine. He was the son of John A. Feeney, who was born in the village of Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland in 1854. By 1878, John had moved to Portland, Maine and opened a saloon, at 42 Center Street, that used a false front to pose as grocery store. John opened four others in following years.\n\nAfter service in the infantry in the Spanish-American War, Francis left home. He drifted into the film business in New York City, working for David Horsley, Al Christie, and the Star Film Company's San Antonio operation under Gaston M\u00e9li\u00e8s. He adopted the name Ford from the automobile.\n\nFrom San Antonio Francis began his Hollywood career working for Thomas H. Ince at Ince's Bison studio, directing and appearing in westerns.\n\nFrancis Ford's younger brother, John M. Feeney, was a successful fullback and defensive tackle on a Portland High state championship football team, nicknamed \"Bull\". In 1914 Bull followed Francis to Hollywood, changed his name to John Ford and would eventually surpass his elder brother's considerable reputation.\n\nFrancis Ford's son, Philip Ford, was also a film actor/director.",
