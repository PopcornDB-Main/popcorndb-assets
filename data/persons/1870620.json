But the acting bug first really bit when he tore up the scenery at Yale University as Jimmy in The Rainmaker, getting a laugh on every line, never getting enough ever since. He has studied with Uta Hagen and Bill Hickey, and has earned a Gold Medal in Acting from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After many years doing stage throughout the country, he came back to Los Angeles to continue in film and television. Lanny speaks fluent Native French and has two French grandchildren.",
