        "biography": "Rob Zombie (born Robert Bartleh Cummings) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, filmmaker, and actor. He founded the heavy metal band White Zombie and has been nominated eight times for the Grammy Award for Best Metal or Hard Rock Performance.\n\nZombie directed the horror film House of 1000 Corpses in 2000, though the controversial project was not released until 2003, and has since been described as a cult classic. Zombie followed the film with two sequels in his \"Firefly\" trilogy: The Devil's Rejects (2005) and 3 From Hell (2019). After the success of his first two films he directed Halloween (2007), a remake of the classic 1978 horror film. The film became his highest-grossing to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed Halloween II (2009), which failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor. Zombie has also directed the films The Haunted World of El Superbeasto (2009), The Lords of Salem (2012), 31 (2016), and The Munsters (2022).",
