She appeared in many of his silents, and in every one of his movies from Union Pacific (1939) on. She was Cecil B. DeMille's  mistress off-screen for quite some time. The devoted DeMille kept her  employed in bit parts long after her career (and their relationship) was  over.  Off-screen, she was known to be a highly skilled horsewoman.\n\nLike many of her contemporaries, her home in Hollywood contained a Chinese room, filled with oriental art objects.",
