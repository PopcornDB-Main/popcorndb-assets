        "biography": "Chantal Goya (born Chantal Deguerre on June 10, 1942 in Saigon) is a French singer and actress.\n\nChantal Goya started her career as a y\u00e9-y\u00e9 girl, singing a catchy mid-'60s hybrid of girl-group pop and French chanson. She also enjoyed a career as a French New Wave actress; she had a starring role as Madeleine in the 1966 Jean-Luc Godard film Masculin, f\u00e9minin and in Jean-Daniel Pollet's L'amour c'est gai, l'amour c'est triste (Love is joy, love is sad).\n\nSince 1975, she has become mostly known as a singer for children. Together with her husband, songwriter and composer Jean-Jacques Debout, and with a talented team of designers and costume people, she does shows for and with children. The main themes are dreams and traveling. Her usual character is Marie-Rose, a mix between a maid and an older sister (reminiscent of Julie Andrews in both The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chantal Goya, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
