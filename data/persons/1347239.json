        "biography": "\"Vicious\" Victor Ortiz\u00a0is an\u00a0American\u00a0professional\u00a0boxer\u00a0of\u00a0Mexican descent.\u00a0He is a former\u00a0WBCWelterweight\u00a0Champion.  He was previously in the\u00a0light welterweight\u00a0division, where he held the\u00a0USBA\u00a0&\u00a0NABO\u00a0titles.\u00a0Ortiz, with a crowd-pleasing, aggressive style, two-fisted power and boyish charm, was made the 2008\u00a0ESPN\u00a0Prospect of the Year.  He was formerly rated as one of the \"top three\" welterweight boxers in the world by most sporting news and boxing websites, including\u00a0The Ring,\u00a0BoxRec.com,\u00a0and\u00a0ESPN. \u00a0  The first loss and the two draws on Ortiz's record are not counted as significant due to the fact the loss came by way ofdisqualification\u00a0in the first round for knocking Corey Alarcon cold with an uppercut off a clinch. The first of two draws was a first-round\u00a0technical draw\u00a0in January 2007, when Ortiz faced\u00a0Marvin Cordova Jr., when an accidental head-butt opened a cut on Ortiz's forehead and rendered him unable to continue.\u00a0The second draw was a controversial one against\u00a0Lamont Peterson, as\u00a0ESPN.comand\u00a0HBO\u00a0unofficial scorer\u00a0Harold Lederman\u00a0both had it 97-91 in favor for the 23-year-old Ortiz. For his first movie role, Ortiz will be in\u00a0The Expendables 3. He will also appear in the upcoming film\u00a0Southpaw.",
