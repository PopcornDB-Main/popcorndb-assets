Starting in the mid-1980s, he toured Germany and Europe with his own group, \"Trio Blamage,\" for 12 years. The trio's stage program\u2014a blend of acrobatics, music, and comedy\u2014was unique at the time, partly because the live act was combined with self-made 16mm films. As an acrobat and actor, Christoph Merg also appeared in Wim Wenders' \"The Brothers Skladanowsky\" and \"Wings of Desire.\" In addition to his work on the \"boards that mean the world,\" he built props and sets for debut and short films, as well as for other independent theater productions. This was the initial spark for his second life, which began in 1999. Since then, he has worked in numerous national and international film and TV productions as a set designer, set decorator and prop master, including for award-winning films such as \"Elser \u2013 He Would Have Changed the World\", \"Mr. Nobody\" and most recently \"All Quiet on the Western Front\".",
