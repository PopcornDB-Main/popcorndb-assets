He became well known during the 1980s, with roles as a youth in films such as Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984), Gremlins (1984), The Goonies (1985), and Stand by Me (1986). In 1987, Feldman starred in the horror film The Lost Boys with Corey Haim; they became known as \"The Two Coreys\" and went on to appear in other films together, including License to Drive (1988) and Dream a Little Dream (1989). He experienced diminishing success in the film industry as an adult, amid well publicized personal conflicts with Haim over the latter's substance abuse, and with Michael Jackson, who had befriended him during his time as a teen celebrity. He has been outspoken about sexual abuse of children and teens in the entertainment industry, identifying himself as a victim of it.",
