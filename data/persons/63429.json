He achieved success with his debut film Watercolor Painting in a Rainy Day in 1989, but the failure of his next two movies led to eight years of unemployment before a comeback with the smash-hit film My Sassy Girl in 2001. He is known for his limitless fondness of love stories set in a mix of different genres.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kwak Jae-yong, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
