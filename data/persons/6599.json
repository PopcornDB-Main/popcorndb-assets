In Movie Encyclopedia, film critic Leonard Maltin describes Morley as \"recognizable by his ungainly bulk, bushy eyebrows, thick lips, and double chin, [\u2026] particularly effective when cast as a pompous windbag\". More politely, Ephraim Katz in his International Film Encyclopaedia describes Morley as a \"a rotund, triple-chinned, delightful character player of the British and American stage and screen.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Morley, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
