        "biography": "Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Martin-Laval (nicknamed \"PEF\") is a French actor, film director, screenwriter and theatre director. PEF is well known in France for his acting performances in musical comedy but also in serious plays. He studied at the famous French school of acting Cours Florent. During his drama studies he met the friends with whom he formed the comedy team 'Les Robins des Bois' (The Robin Hoods) in 1996. Initially called The Royal Imperial Green Rabbit Company, they renamed themselves after their first significant success, a play entitled Robins des bois.\n\nLes Robins des Bois first appeared on television in La Grosse Emission, a regular TV show on the channel Com\u00e9die! in which they presented short and utterly crazy plays. They quickly became popular and made appearances in French movies.\n\nSource: Article \"Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Martin-Laval\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
