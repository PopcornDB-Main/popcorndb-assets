He played also the main character in two Jean Vigo movies, L'Atalante and Z\u00e9ro de conduite. Later, he worked also with Alain Resnais and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.\n\nHe married Danish-born actress Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Copeau (1902\u20131994), the daughter of the influential French writer, editor, and drama critic Jacques Copeau (1879\u20131949) and Agn\u00e8s Thomsen.\n\nIn 1947, he became the founding director of the Comedie de St.-Etienne stage company in the town of Saint-\u00c9tienne in the Loire d\u00e9partement. The success of his theater was such that there is a college and a theater in Saint-\u00c9tienne named in his honor.\n\nSource: Article \"Jean Dast\u00e9\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
