She attended the Jules Ferry School in Anzin. One day as she was leaving the school holding her little sister in her arms, she came across three women who were distributing flyers for a casting and caught the eye of the casting director of the film The Worst Ones, who left her number with Wanecque. She passed the audition and then quit high school to devote herself to a film career.\n\nIn 2022, Wanecque made her film debut with a starring role in the drama The Worst Ones, directed by Lise Akoka and Romane Gueret, for which she won the Rising Star Award for Best International Young Actor at the 2022 Rome Film Festival, and was nominated for the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress in 2023.
