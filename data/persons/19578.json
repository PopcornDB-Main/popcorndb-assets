        "biography": "Alexis Arquette (July 28, 1969 \u2013 September 11, 2016) was an American actress and transgender activist.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, she was the fourth of five children to Lewis Arquette, an actor and director, and Brenda Olivia \"Mardi\" (n\u00e9e Nowak), an actress. Coming from a family deeply entrenched in the entertainment industry, Alexis was the sibling of actors Rosanna, Richmond, Patricia, and David Arquette. Her career began in her youth, appearing aged 12 in the music video \"She's a Beauty\" by The Tubes and making her screen debut in Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986). Known for her versatility, Arquette often performed as a female impersonator under the name \"Eva Destruction\", before publicly sharing her transition process towards gender-affirming surgery. Her filmography includes a range of roles, from starring roles in small productions like Jumpin' at the Boneyard (1992), Things I Never Told You (1996) and I Think I Do (1997) to appearances in mainstream hits like Threesome, Pulp Fiction (both 1994), The Wedding Singer, Bride of Chucky (both 1998), She's All That (1999) and Blended (2014).\n\nArquette's personal life was marked by her vocal support for the transgender community and candidness about her own transition journey, which was documented in the film Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother. Despite facing health challenges, including contracting HIV in 1987 and later health complications, Arquette continued to be an active figure in entertainment and advocacy, until her death in 2016 aged 47.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alexis Arquette, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
