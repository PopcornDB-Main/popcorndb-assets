These three stories intertwine to explain how life in Jackson, Mississippi revolves around \"the help\"; yet they are always kept at a certain distance because of racial lines.",

Thrust in among mean gals, nice gals and just plain weird gals, Beca finds that the only thing they have in common is how well they sing together. She takes the women of the group out of their comfort zone of traditional arrangements and into a world of amazing harmonic combinations in a fight to the top of college music competitions.",
