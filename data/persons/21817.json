She signed with Storm Model Management and began working as a print model using her middle name March, which was also her birth month.\n\nAfter being spotted on the cover of Just Seventeen by French director\u00a0Jean-Jacques Annaud, she was chosen to play the female lead in his film\u00a0The Lover\u00a0(1992), based on a semi autobiographical novel by\u00a0Marguerite Duras.\n\nTwo years after\u00a0The Lover\u00a0(1992), she co-starred with\u00a0Bruce Willis\u00a0in the erotic thriller\u00a0Color of Night\u00a0(1994), directed by\u00a0Richard Rush. She later said, \"I didn't like the script at all, but it was a Bruce Willis film and I wasn't going to turn it down\".\n\nWhile\u00a0Color of Night\u00a0(1994) was in production, March began dating the film's co-producer\u00a0Carmine Zozzora. The couple married in June 1993 in an 11-minute ceremony at which\u00a0Bruce Willis\u00a0was the best man and\u00a0Demi Moore\u00a0was the maid of honor. They separated in 1997 and finally divorced in 2001.",
