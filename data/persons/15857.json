Though handsome enough to play leading roles, and versatile enough to play a wide variety of character parts, Booth naturally projected a shifty, wolfish, or unpredictable quality that led inevitably to villainous roles and comedy, usually with a cockney flavour. He is probably best known for his role as Vic Fielding in the British soap opera Coronation Street.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James Booth, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
