        "biography": "Christopher Joseph Columbus\u00a0(born September 10, 1958) is an American filmmaker. Born in\u00a0Spangler, Pennsylvania, Columbus studied film at\u00a0New York University's Tisch School of the Arts\u00a0where he developed an interest in filmmaking. After writing screenplays for several\u00a0teen\u00a0comedies in the mid-1980s, including\u00a0Gremlins,\u00a0The Goonies, and\u00a0Young Sherlock Holmes, he made his\u00a0directorial debut with a teen adventure,\u00a0Adventures in Babysitting(1987). Columbus gained recognition soon after with the highly successful Christmas comedy\u00a0Home Alone\u00a0(1990) and\u00a0Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\u00a0(1992).\n\nThe comedy\u00a0Mrs. Doubtfire\u00a0(1993), starring\u00a0Robin Williams, was another box-office success for Columbus. He went on to direct several other films throughout the 1990s, which were mostly met with lukewarm reception. However, he found commercial success again by directing the film adaptations of\u00a0J. K. Rowling's novels\u00a0Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\u00a0(2001) and its sequel,\u00a0Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\u00a0(2002). In addition to directing, Columbus was a producer for\u00a0Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u00a0(2004), as well as the drama\u00a0The Help(2011). He also directed the fantasy\u00a0Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief(2010) and the\u00a03D\u00a0action comedy\u00a0Pixels\u00a0(2015).\n\nColumbus is the co-founder of\u00a01492 Pictures, a film production company that has produced some of his films since 1995. More recently, he co-founded another production firm with his daughter in 2014 called Maiden Voyage Pictures. In 2017, he launched ZAG Animation Studios, alongside\u00a0Michael Barnathan,\u00a0Haim Saban, and Jeremy Zag. Columbus is also known for his collaboration with composer\u00a0John Williams, with whom he had worked on the film\u00a0Home Alone\u00a0and the film series\u00a0Harry Potter.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chris Columbus, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
