        "biography": "\u00c9ric Caravaca (born 21 November 1966) is a French actor, film director and screenwriter.\n\nThe son of an engineer, Caravaca (of Spanish origin) studied literature while taking acting lessons. After obtaining his degree, he left for Paris, where he joined l'\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et techniques du th\u00e9\u00e2tre, and completed his formation at the Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur d'art dramatique. He then went to New York City in 1993, where he studied at the Actors Studio for a year.\n\nUpon his return to France, he began his career in theatre and gained attention in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. He made his film debut in 1996, in Un samedi sur la terre by Diane Bertrand. He played mostly small roles until C'est quoi la vie?, directed by Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron in 1999, which earned him the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actor. He worked again with Dupeyron in La chambre des officiers in 2001, and appeared as Luc in Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's film Son fr\u00e8re in 2003, opposite Bruno Todeschini.\n\nHe directed his first film The Passenger in 2005, in which he also played a role (Thomas), opposite Julie Depardieu, which was presented at the Venice Film Festival.\n\n(Wikipedia)",
