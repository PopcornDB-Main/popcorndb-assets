        "biography": "Jean-Claude Brialy (30 March 1933 \u2013 30 May 2007) was a French actor and film director.\n\nBrialy was born in Aumale (now Sour El-Ghozlane), French Algeria, where his father was stationed with the French Army. Brialy moved to mainland France with his family in 1942. He was an alumnus of the Prytan\u00e9e National Militaire. When he was 21 years old, he went to Paris to work as an actor.\n\nIn 1956, Brialy acted in his first role in the short film Le coup du berger (Fool's Mate) by Jacques Rivette.\n\nBy the late 1950s, he'd become one of the most prolific actors in the French nouvelle vague and a star. He appeared in films of nouvelle vague directors such as Claude Chabrol (Le Beau Serge, 1958; Les Cousins, 1959), Louis Malle (Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud, 1958; Les Amants, 1958), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (Les 400 Coups, 1959), Jean-Luc Godard, (Une femme est une femme, 1961), \u00c9ric Rohmer (Claire's Knee, 1970), as well as in films of other filmmakers such as Jean Renoir (Elena et les hommes 1958), Roger Vadim (La ronde, 1964), Philippe de Broca (Le Roi de c\u0153ur, 1966), Luis Bu\u00f1uel (Le Fant\u00f4me de la libert\u00e9, 1974), and Claude Lelouch (Robert et Robert, 1978).\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in his last role, as the eponymous character of the TV film Monsieur Max, directed by Gabriel Aghion. Godard described him as \"the French Cary Grant,\" while Brialy's self-described \"life models\" had reportedly been actor Sacha Guitry and director Jean Cocteau.\n\nBrialy directed a number of films, including \u00c9glantine in 1971, which was loosely inspired by his own memories of a happy childhood spent in Chambellay with his grandparents, and Les volets clos (Closed shutters) in 1972.\n\nHe owned the restaurant L'Orangerie, on the \u00cele Saint-Louis; he'd also worked as a TV presenter, a singer, and a radio host. During the presentation of one of his books, Brialy described himself this way: \"I'm a boy who got lucky enough to do what I love in life\".\n\nBrialy, in 1959, acquired a ch\u00e2teau in the commune of Monthyon, near Paris. There, he accommodated and entertained many friends from the cinema and the theatre, such as Jean Marais, Pierre Arditi, and Romy Schneider whom he'd met during the 1958 production of the film Christine. Schneider, after the 1981 fatal accident of her son David, found a \"refuge from the paparazzi\" in Brialy's home. French singer Barbara would often sing at the piano. Director Jean-Pierre Melville used the ch\u00e2teau to shoot the last scenes of his 1970 crime film Le Cercle Rouge, where Alain Delon and Yves Montand are killed by the police.\n\nIn his books, the autobiographical Le Ruisseau des singes (The river of monkeys) (2000) and the memoir J'ai oubli\u00e9 de vous dire (I Forgot to Tell You) (2004), Brialy revealed that he was bisexual. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Jean-Claude Brialy\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
