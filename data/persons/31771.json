He provided the voices of various characters for\u00a0Disney\u00a0(Black Pete\u00a0and the\u00a0Big Bad Wolf\u00a0in\u00a0Three Little Pigs\u00a0and its spin-offs),\u00a0MGM\u00a0(Spike the Bulldog\u00a0and in some occasions even Tom, in\u00a0Tom and Jerry), and\u00a0Warner Bros.\u00a0(many characters, most notably the Papa Bear of\u00a0Chuck Jones'\u00a0The Three Bears\u00a0after\u00a0Mel Blanc\u00a0had performed the role in the initial entry). He appeared opposite Blanc in\u00a0Little Red Riding Rabbit, where he played another famous wolf. Bletcher's booming voice can also be heard as \"Dom Del Oro\" the Yacqi Indian god in the 1939 Republic serial,\u00a0Zorro's Fighting Legion. He also voiced Owl Jolson's disciplinarian violinist father in the 1936\u00a0short subject\u00a0based on the song\u00a0I Love to Singa\u00a0and the menacing\u00a0spider\u00a0in\u00a0Bingo Crosbyana. Both he and Mel Blanc did voice acting in the 1944\u00a0Private Snafu\u00a0WWII training film \"Gas\", where Bletcher plays the villainous Gas Cloud (with Mel Blanc voicing Private Snafu and a\u00a0cameo\u00a0of Bugs Bunny) as an opponent of Snafu. Bletcher also played The Captain in\u00a0Captain and the Kids\u00a0with MGM cartoons.",
