He is best known for his hit songs like \"The Ghetto\" and \"Blow the Whistle\" and \"Ain't Nothing Like Pimpin'\". Too Short is one of the very few musicians to have been able to collaborate with both 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. during the height of their careers when the rappers engaged in a protracted feud.\n\nToo Short is credited as being one of the pioneer rappers of West Coast hip hop. His rap lyrics are primarily about pimping, drug use, and promiscuity.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Too Short, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
