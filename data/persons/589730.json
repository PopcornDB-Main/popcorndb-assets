        "biography": "Blue Washington was born on February 12, 1898 in Los Angeles, California, as Edgar Hughes Washington. He was an actor, known for There It Is (1928), Beggars of Life (1928) and Haunted Gold (1932). He was married to Marion Len\u00e1n. He died on September 15, 1970, at Mira Loma Hospital in Lancaster, California. He was laid to rest at Evergreen Memorial Park in Los Angeles. His son,\u00a0Kenny Washington, was buried beside him in 1971.\n\nEdgar 'Blue' Washington was also a ballplayer in the Negro League for the Los Angeles White Sox and (briefly) the Kansas City Monarchs.\n\nHe was a childhood friend of Frank Capra and appeared as John Wayne\u2019s sidekick in Haunted Gold  (1932), but it wasn\u2019t always clear he was headed for Hollywood.\u00a0 He  played professional baseball in the 1910s and 1920s for two of the most  glamorous African American teams in existence, and for a time it must  have seemed obvious that this was his vocation.\u00a0 In the end he chose a  different path.\u00a0 It certainly wasn\u2019t easier \u2014 Hollywood at that time was  only marginally more accepting of black contributions than the white  major leagues.\u00a0 The nickname 'Blue' came from Frank Capra, one of his best pals in the ethnically diverse surroundings of Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles.",
