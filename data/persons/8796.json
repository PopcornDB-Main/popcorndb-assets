In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his generals and advisers to fight to the last man.

        "biography": "Ulrich Matthes was born in Berlin. He studied acting in the early 1980's in Berlin under Else Bongers. Ulrich Matthes studied German and English, because he really wanted to become a teacher, so he also took private acting lessons during his studies. His first engagement brought him to the Vereinigte B\u00fchnen in Krefeld, where he played the title role in \"Prinz Friedrich von Homburg\". Later he came to D\u00fcsseldorf Schauspielhaus, the Bavarian State Theatre, the Munich Studio Theater and the Schaub\u00fchne place. Since the 2004/2005 season, he is member of the ensemble at Deutsches Theater in Berlin. In the 2004 movieThe Ninth Day, he plays Fr. Henri Kremer, a Catholic priest imprisoned at Dachau.\n\nIn 2005 he was voted \"Actor of the Year\" by 'Theater heute' magazine for his performance in Edward Albees' \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\".\n\nUlrich Matthes has also dubbed many American actors such as Kenneth Braga, Malcom McDowell, Charlie Sheen, Ralph Fiennes, and Richard Thomas.\n\nDescription above from the Wikia site Hitler Parody, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikia.",
