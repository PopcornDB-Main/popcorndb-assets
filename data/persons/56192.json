        "biography": "Fred George \"Fritz\" Manes was born on April 22, 1932 in Oakland, California. He met Clint Eastwood when both were attending Piedmont Junior High School. Manes served in the Marines during the Korean War and studied acting at the University of California, Los Angeles. He held a variety of jobs in radio and television before being hired by Clint Eastwood's production company, Malpaso, in 1973. During the 1970s and 1980s, Manes worked on a long list of Eastwood films as an associate producer, producer, or executive producer. He also occasionally played small roles or did stunt work. During the filming of Heartbreak Ridge, Manes and Eastwood had a falling out and Manes was unceremoniously fired from Malpaso. He later formed his own production company, Sundancer, and served on the California Film Commission.",
