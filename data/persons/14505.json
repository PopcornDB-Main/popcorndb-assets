Stone (March 3, 1913 \u2013 November 18, 2005) was an American film and television character actor.\n\nBorn Harold Hochstein to a Jewish acting family, he began his career on Broadway in 1939 and appeared in five plays in the next six years, including One Touch of Venus and Stalag 17, following which he made his motion picture debut in the Alan Ladd film noir classic The Blue Dahlia (1946). He went on to work in small but memorable roles in such films as The Harder They Fall with Humphrey Bogart (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man (1956), Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), Spartacus (1960) and Girl Happy (1965). Although he would go on to perform secondary roles in a number of films, he became a recognizable face to television viewers for his more than 150 guest appearances on numerous shows dating from the 1950s to the early 1980s including but not limited to The Restless Gun, United States Marshal, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, I Spy, The Virginian, Griff, The Untouchables, The Twilight Zone, Hogan's Heroes and Get Smart.
