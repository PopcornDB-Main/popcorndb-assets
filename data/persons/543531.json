She is better known for her work in the World Wrestling Federation under her ring name The Kat.\n\nDuring her tenure in the World Wrestling Federation, she held the Women's Championship once, although she was not a trained wrestler. During the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 1999, she flashed her breasts in what was an early instance of intentional nudity in the WWF. After the event, she was shown nude several more times on other pay-per-views. She is also an ex-wife of wrestler and color-commentator Jerry Lawler, who quit the WWF after Carter was released in early 2001 but returned after their divorce in July 2001. She currently works on the independent circuit under her real name.",
