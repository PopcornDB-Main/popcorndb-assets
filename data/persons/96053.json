        "biography": "Charles Judels (17\u00a0August 1882 \u2013 14 February 1969) was a Dutch actor. He first starred on vaudeville in the early 1900s, and made his Broadway stage debut in The Ziegfeld Follies in 1912. Judels appeared in more than 130 American comedy and drama movies and was an expert with dialects. That talent served him well throughout his career. His first film was a comedy, Old Dutch, in 1915.\n\nJudels is perhaps best remembered as the cheese store proprietor in Laurel & Hardy's 1938 film Swiss Miss. He also did extensive work as a voice actor in animated films, most notably as the voice of Stromboli in Disney's Pinocchio (1940). His final appearance on screen was as a Danite merchant in Samson and Delilah in 1949.",
