Raised in Glasgow (Scotland), he took the scenic route to the Performing Arts by first studying Computer Science at the University of Strathclyde. He figured that if the acting didn't work out, he would have something to fall back on.\n\nFor those with a keen eye, he can be spotted in films such as Gran Turismo (2023), Mary Queen of Scots (2018), and Bellbottom (2021). His television credits include Armchair Detectives (2017) , a fleeting appearance in Slow Horses (2022) season 1, and a new upcoming Netflix series.\n\nHe is also a writer and director, mainly through his fledgling film company, Restless Chimp. In 2024, he was awarded a short film commission by the National Theatre of Scotland to write and direct Kinaara, a story about the challenges of dementia care in the South Asian community.",
