        "biography": "Antonio Centa (10 August 1907 \u2013 19 April 1979) was an Italian film actor.\n\nBorn in Maniago, Province of Pordenone, Centa was among the most active and popular actors between the mid-1930s and 1943 (when the Italian film industry almost halted because of the war). He was especially popular with the female audience, and had critically acclaimed performances, notably in Renato Castellani's films A Pistol Shot and Zaz\u00e0. After the war his success declined, and he gradually started to be cast in supporting roles.\n\nSource: Article \"Antonio Centa\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
