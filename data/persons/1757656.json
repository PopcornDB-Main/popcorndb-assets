The role of Mr Doyle was one not too far from his own real life experiences. In the 1980s, Welsh was a Hibs Casual football hooligan and staged organised smash and grab robberies on department stores. Later, he organised security for 100s of Edinburgh clubs and spent four years in prison for extorting money from estate agents. In more recent years, Welsh  became involved in charity projects in Edinburgh, including helping young people to stay away from a life of crime through his Holyrood Boxing Gym. On the evening of April 17th, Welsh was shot dead outside his home in Chester Street, Edinburgh in an isolated attack. He was forty-eight-years old.",
