        "biography": "Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 (9 April 1933 \u2013 6 December 1994) was an Italian actor. He is perhaps most famous outside of Italy for his roles as the main villain in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (credited in the USA as \"Johnny Wels\") and For a Few Dollars More.\n\nIn Italy and much of Europe, he was notable for his roles in high-profile social dramas depicting the political and social stirrings of Italian and European society in the 1960s and 1970s, including four films directed by Elio Petri - We Still Kill the Old Way (1967), Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1971), The Working Class Goes to Heaven (1971) and Todo modo (1976). He is also recognized for his performances in Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge (1970) and Giuliano Montaldo's Sacco & Vanzetti (1971).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Gian Maria Volont\u00e9, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
