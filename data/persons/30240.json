        "biography": "Frank Orth was an American actor born in Philadelphia. He is probably best remembered for his portrayal of Inspector Faraday in the 1951-1953 television series \u201cBoston Blackie\u201d. By 1897, Orth was performing in vaudeville with his wife, Ann Codee, in an act called \u201cCodee and Orth.\u201d In 1909, he expanded into song writing, with songs such as \u201cThe Phone Bell Rang\u201d and \u201cMeet Me on the Boardwalk, Dearie.\u201d His first contact with motion pictures was in 1928, when he was part of the first foreign-language shorts in sound produced by Warner Bros. He and his wife also appeared together in a series of two-reel comedies in the early 1930s. Orth's first major screen credit was in \u201cPrairie Thunder,\u201d a Dick Foran western, in 1937. From then on, he was often cast as bartenders, pharmacists, and grocery clerks, and always distinctly Irish. He had a recurring role in the Dr. Kildare series of films and also in the Nancy Drew series as the befuddled Officer Tweedy. Among his better roles were the newspaper man Cary Grant telephones early in \u201cHis Girl Friday,\u201d one of the quartet singing \u201cGary Owen\u201d in \u201cThey Died with Their Boots On\u201d (thereby giving Errol Flynn as Gen. Custer the idea of associating the tune with the 7th Cavalry), and as the little man carrying the sign reading \u201cThe End Is Near\u201d throughout Colonel Effingham's Raid. However, Orth is probably best remembered for his portrayal of Inspector Faraday in the 1951-1953 television series \u201cBoston Blackie.\u201d A short, plump, round-faced man, often smoking a cigar, Orth as Faraday wore his own dark-rimmed spectacles, though rarely in feature films. In 1959, Orth retired from show business after throat surgery. His wife died in 1961 after around fifty years of marriage. Orth died on March 17, 1962. He is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in the Hollywood Hills next to his wife.",
