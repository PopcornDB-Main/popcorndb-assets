You may recognize her as Patrick's Mom on SpongeBob SquarePants, Mrs. Nasenpickle on Squirrel Boy, or as the sassy germ, Germama in Kirby Buckets on Disney XD. She can be seen and heard on cartoons, TV commercials, radio spots, and even in your favorite theme parks such as California Adventure.\n\nSusan was recently featured on the front page of the New York Times Arts Section heralding her voice talent and casting work with her loop group, Loop Out Loud. She has become the industry go-to for horror creature voices, (both performing and voice directing). Her work is featured in such television shows and films as Freaky, The Conjuring 3, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Midnight Mass. Though she loves horror, and the challenges it brings, she has been fortunate to work on hundreds of diverse projects, ranging from big budget blockbusters to indie films, features to television, comedy to horror, and everything in between.\n\nYou may also recognize Susan's work from her numerous TV and Film appearances as Mrs. Robinson in Fresh Off the Boat, the role of Nurse in Ray Donovan, Helena in the Lifetime Movie, Twisted Twin, or as the Casting Director in Our Almost Completely True Story.\n\nWhen she is not in the recording studio, Susan runs her passion project, the Voiceover Connection- a V/O school she co-founded that instructs and guides the next generation of VoiceOver actors.",
