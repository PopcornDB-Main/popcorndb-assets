        "biography": "Curtis James Jackson III\u00a0(born July 6, 1975), known professionally as\u00a050 Cent,\u00a0is an American rapper, actor, and television producer. Born in\u00a0Queens, a borough of\u00a0New York City, Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999\u20132000, he recorded his debut album\u00a0Power of the Dollar\u00a0for\u00a0Columbia Records; however, he was struck by nine bullets during a shooting in May 2000, causing its release to be cancelled. Jackson is to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape,\u00a0Guess Who's Back?, was discovered by Detroit rapper\u00a0Eminem, who signed Jackson to his label\u00a0Shady Records, an imprint of\u00a0Dr. Dre's\u00a0Aftermath Entertainment\u00a0and\u00a0Interscope Records\u00a0that same year.\n\nHis debut studio album,\u00a0Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Peaking atop the\u00a0Billboard200, it spawned the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100-number singles \"In da Club\" and \"21 Questions\" (featuring\u00a0Nate Dogg). It received\u00a0nonuple platinum certification by the\u00a0Recording Industry Association of America\u00a0(RIAA). That same year, he launched the record label\u00a0G-Unit Records, the namesake of\u00a0a hip-hop group\u00a0he formed two years prior; the label's initial signees were its members, fellow East Coast rappers\u00a0Lloyd Banks\u00a0and\u00a0Tony Yayo. His second album,\u00a0The Massacre\u00a0(2005), was met with similar success and supported by his third number-one single, \"Candy Shop\" (featuring\u00a0Olivia). He adopted a lighter, further commercially oriented approach for his third and fourth albums,\u00a0Curtis\u00a0(2007) and\u00a0Before I Self Destruct\u00a0(2009)\u2014both were met with critical and commercial declines\u2014and aimed for a return to his roots with his fifth album,\u00a0Animal Ambition\u00a0(2014), which was met with mixed reviews. He has since focused on his career in television and media, having executive-produced and starred in the television series\u00a0Power\u00a0(2014\u20132020), as well as its numerous spin-offs under his company\u00a0G-Unit Films and Television Inc.\n\nJackson has sold over 30\u00a0million albums worldwide and earned\u00a0several accolades, including a\u00a0Grammy Award, a\u00a0Primetime Emmy Award, thirteen\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Music Awards, six\u00a0World Music Awards, three\u00a0American Music Awards\u00a0and four\u00a0BET Awards.\u00a0In his acting career, Jackson first starred in the semi-autobiographical film\u00a0Get Rich or Die Tryin'\u00a0(2005), which received critical panning. He was also cast in the war film\u00a0Home of the Brave\u00a0(2006) and the crime thriller\u00a0Righteous Kill\u00a0(2008).\u00a0Billboard\u00a0ranked Jackson as 17th on their \"50 Greatest Rappers\" list in 2023.\u00a0and named him the sixth top artist of the 2000s decade.\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0ranked\u00a0Get Rich or Die Tryin'\u00a0and \"In da Club\" in its lists of the \"100 Best Albums of the 2000s\" and \"100 Best Songs of the 2000s\" at numbers 37 and 13, respectively.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article 50 Cent, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
