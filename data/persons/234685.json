I wanted to be sure that even a child with no sense of rhythm could dance The Macarena.\" She appears in and choreographed the dance routine for the Wes Madiko music video for his song \"Alane\". She was the main choreographer for a comeback show by French pop singer Sheila in 1998, at the Olympia, Paris.\n\nFrye has taken part in French reality shows, starting with French version of Popstars in 2001, the inaugural season for the show. She coached the girl band L5.\n\nIn 2004, she took part in La Ferme C\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9s, another reality television show with the task of collecting funds for a charitable association. She returned to French Popstars in 2007, the program's 4th season, as official choreographer mentor for the show.\n\nIn 2012, she was a part of the jury in Encore une chance (subtitle: Les plus belles voix de la t\u00e9l\u00e9 r\u00e9alit\u00e9) broadcast on NRJ 12. Other jury members included Richard Cross, St\u00e9phane Joffre-Rom\u00e9as and Morgan Serrano.\n\nSource: Article \"Mia Frye\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
