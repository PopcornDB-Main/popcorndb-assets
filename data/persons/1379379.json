Although neither of his parents is professionally engaged in acting, they were always fans of the art: his mother sings and his father acted in some school plays.  Benny instead decided to make a career out of this art. Benny tends to work with characters who are real, who have real problems, who are complex, multifaceted human beings.  One of Benny's wishes is to participate in a film that will last in the history of Mexican cinema no matter how many generations and new proposals pass over it.",
