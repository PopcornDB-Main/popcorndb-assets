        "biography": "Michael Marshall (September 13, 1944 \u2013 June 2, 2005) was a French American actor.\n\nMarshall was born in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital in Hollywood on September 13, 1944. When his parents divorced, his father made sure that he received an American education. He began studying law, but dreamed of becoming an actor. He later joined his mother in Paris. Marshall began to take drama classes from Raymond Griard and later directed his first film, Potato, in France under the direction of Robert Thomas, adapted from the play's eponymous Marcel Achard. He had already appeared in two films from overseas, the first was directed by his father, and the second by Vincente Minnelli. G\u00e9rard Oury, Marshall's step-father, offered him a role of a young Canadian airman in La Grande Vadrouille, as a doctor in Le Coup du parapluie. Marshall had a long, low-key career as a character actor in French cinema. On stage he starred in Croque-monsieur, Le Vallon, and Point de feu sans fum\u00e9e. Marshall has also appeared in several television series.\n\nHe was the only child of American actor-director William Marshall and French actress Mich\u00e8le Morgan and was the stepson of G\u00e9rard Oury as well as half-brother to Tonie Marshall. Marshall fathered six children. He died in Caen, France, aged 60, survived by his mother.\n\nSource: Article \"Mike Marshall (actor)\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
