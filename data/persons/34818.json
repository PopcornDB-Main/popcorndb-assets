By the time of his final performance in 1951, he had appeared in over 350 films, almost all in small and/or uncredited parts.\n\nHe is probably best remembered today for his role as Harvey Yates, a con artist captured and hand-cuffed to fellow con artist Penelope, played by Kay Francis at the very end of the Marx Brothers first film The Cocoanuts (1929).",
