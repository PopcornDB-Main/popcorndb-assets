As well, he did some work for PBS, most notably appearing in a film about the Civil War.\n\nHe married Rukmini Sukarno, an opera singer who was a daughter of President Sukarno of Indonesia. Their son, Chris Kline, is a journalist.\n\nOn November 29, 1998, he died in his sleep, at the age of 72. His remains were cremated and buried beneath a venerable old apple tree on ancestral property in Vermont.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Frank Latimore, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
