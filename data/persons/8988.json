His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in 1931. Dal\u00ed's expansive artistic repertoire includes film, sculpture, and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.\n\nDal\u00ed attributed his \"love of everything that is gilded and excessive, my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes\" to a self-styled \"Arab lineage,\" claiming that his ancestors were descended from the Moors.\n\nDal\u00ed was highly imaginative, and also had an affinity for partaking in unusual and grandiose behavior. His eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork to the dismay of those who held his work in high esteem and to the irritation of his critics.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Salvador Dal\u00ed, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
