He is best known for his role as\u00a0Connor MacLeod, or simply \"The Highlander\", from\u00a0the movie\u00a0and\u00a0subsequent movie franchise series of the same name. He is also known for his roles as\u00a0Tarzan\u00a0in\u00a0Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes\u00a0and as the thunder god\u00a0Raiden\u00a0in the first movie adaptation of the video game\u00a0Mortal Kombat. He is credited internationally as\u00a0Christopher Lambert, with the exceptions of French-speaking countries, where he is known as\u00a0Christophe Lambert.\n\nLambert was married to\u00a0Diane Lane\u00a0from October 1988\u00a0to 1994.\u00a0They have a daughter, Eleanor Jasmine. He married Jaiymse Haft on 6 February 1999.\u00a0Since 2007, Lambert has been in a relationship with\u00a0Sophie Marceau, with whom he appeared in\u00a0La disparue de Deauville.\u00a0They married in 2012.\n\nLambert has profound\u00a0myopia\u00a0and cannot see without his glasses. Because he cannot wear contact lenses, he is often forced to act while virtually blind. This has led to injuries while performing his own stunts without glasses.\u00a0His myopia is often credited as being part of his appeal, by giving his stare a peculiar charm.\n\nLambert is also sole owner of Lamb Bear Productions, the name of the company is a play on his name \"pronounced Lamb-bear\".",
