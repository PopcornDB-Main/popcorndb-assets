Rachael knew from a very young age that all she wanted to do was act, so her parents let her pursue her career early on. Her natural talent for acting got her accepted into one of the most prestigious acting schools in London, 'The Anna Scher Theatre School' where she trained for 3 years. It didn't take long for Rachael to start booking roles and she has enjoyed a wonderfully diverse career thus far.
