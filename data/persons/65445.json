Roukin was born in Southport, and currently lives in Kentish Town, North London. He displayed an interest in drama from an early age. After completing secondary school at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby where he was involved in many school productions and where he now returns to give acting workshops to the pupils involved in drama and English, he went on to train at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, graduating in 2003. Roukin finished filming Bright Star, directed by Jane Campion and based on the three-year romance between 19th century poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by Keats' death at age 25. Roukin starred in the 2008 hit film Happy Go Lucky as the main character's (Poppy, played by Sally Hawkins) love interest. According to the review on The Independent website by Jonathan Romney, ( Poppy ) \"Realising one of her pupils is unhappy, she takes action that results in her meeting a simpatico social worker (Samuel Roukin), leading to possibly the single most convincing, no-nonsense, outright charming flirtation scene I've seen in cinema.\" The film directed by the multiple award winning Mike Leigh won a host of nominations and awards worldwide for the film. Roukin played a Snatcher in the two-part finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I &amp; Part II. He was recently interviewed by DemonFM in Leicester about his current stage work. ITV's recent two part drama DCI Banks - Aftermath featuring Stephen Tompkinson had Samuel playing the lead villain in a prime time mini series that was watched by over 5.5 million viewers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Samuel Roukin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
