In August 1950, the Theatre de la Huchette in Paris presented Pepita ou Cinq cents francs de bonheur, a three-act comedy that Chevit co-wrote with Henri Fontenille; Chevit himself appeared in it, playing alongside Jacqueline Maillan, Pierre Mondy and Jacques Jouanneau. He was seen in many small film roles during the 1950s and 1960s, working with producers such as Henri Decoin and Andr\u00e9 Cayatte, but he was best known as a stage actor.\n\nSource: Article \"Maurice Chevit\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
