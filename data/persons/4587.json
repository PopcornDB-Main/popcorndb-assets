She began her career as a model and entered several beauty contests, finishing as the first runner-up in the\u00a0Miss USA\u00a0pageant of 1986 and also placing sixth in\u00a0Miss World 1986. Her breakthrough film role was in the romantic comedy\u00a0Boomerang\u00a0(1992), alongside\u00a0Eddie Murphy, which led to roles in\u00a0The Flintstones (1994) and\u00a0Bulworth\u00a0(1998) as well as the television film\u00a0Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won a\u00a0Primetime Emmy Award\u00a0and a\u00a0Golden Globe Award.\n\nBerry established herself as one of the highest-paid actresses in\u00a0Hollywood\u00a0during the 2000s. For her performance as a struggling widow in the romantic drama\u00a0Monster's Ball\u00a0(2001), Berry became the only African-American woman to win the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Actress, and the first\u00a0woman of colour. Berry took on high-profile roles such as\u00a0Storm\u00a0in four instalments of the\u00a0X-Men film series\u00a0(2000\u20132014), the henchwoman of a robber in the thriller\u00a0Swordfish\u00a0(2001),\u00a0Bond girl Jinx\u00a0in\u00a0Die Another Day\u00a0(2002), and the title role in the much-derided\u00a0Catwoman\u00a0(2004).\n\nA varying critical and commercial reception followed in subsequent years, with\u00a0Perfect Stranger\u00a0(2007),\u00a0Cloud Atlas\u00a0(2012) and\u00a0The Call (2013) being among her notable film releases in that period. Berry launched a production company,\u00a0606 Films, in 2014 and has been involved in the production of a number of projects in which she performed, such as the\u00a0CBS\u00a0science fiction series\u00a0Extant\u00a0(2014\u20132015). She appeared in the action films\u00a0Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017) and\u00a0John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum\u00a0(2019) and made her directorial debut with the\u00a0Netflix\u00a0drama\u00a0Bruised\u00a0(2020).\n\nBerry has been a\u00a0Revlon\u00a0spokesmodel since 1996. She was formerly married to baseball player\u00a0David Justice, singer-songwriter\u00a0Eric Ben\u00e9t, and actor\u00a0Olivier Martinez. Berry has two children.
