He is popular for his films from a wide range of genres, including screwball comedies [Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)], westerns [Red River (1948), Rio Bravo (1959), El Dorado (1967)], adventure films [Only Angels Have Wings (1939), To Have and Have Not (1944)], films noirs [The Big Sleep (1946)] and gangster films [Scarface (1932)]. Notable characteristics of his films are independent and tough-talking female protagonists (\"Hawksian woman\") and witty and fast-paced dialogues.\n\nIn 1975, Hawks was awarded the Honorary Academy Award as \"a master American filmmaker whose creative efforts hold a distinguished place in world cinema,\" and in 1942 he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for Sergeant York.\n\nHawks has been considered by film critics to be an auteur because of his recognizable style and frequent use of certain thematic elements.
