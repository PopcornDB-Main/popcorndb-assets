        "biography": "Sean Michael Leonard Anderson (born March 25, 1988), known professionally as Big Sean, is an American rapper. He met Kanye West as a teenager, and signed with his record label GOOD Music, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings in 2007. He gained popularity following the release of his third mixtape, Finally Famous Vol. 3: Big (2010). His first two studio albums, Finally Famous (2011) and Hall of Fame (2013), both peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top 40 singles \"My Last\" (featuring Chris Brown), \"Marvin & Chardonnay\" (featuring Kanye West and Roscoe Dash), \"Dance (Ass)\" (remixed featuring Nicki Minaj), and \"Beware\" (featuring Lil Wayne and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko).\n\nHis third album, Dark Sky Paradise (2015), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was led by the single \"I Don't Fuck with You\" (featuring E-40), which received octuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); each of the album's singles\u2014\"Paradise\", \"Blessings\" (featuring Drake and Kanye West), \"One Man Can Change the World\" (featuring John Legend and Kanye West), and \"Play No Games\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign and Chris Brown)\u2014also received platinum certification. His fourth and fifth albums, I Decided (2017) and Detroit 2 (2020), both also debuted atop the chart; the former was supported by the single \"Bounce Back\", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song. In the following year of the latter album's release, he dissociated with West and parted ways with GOOD Music. His sixth album, Better Me Than You (2024), moderately entered the Billboard 200 at number 25, and received mixed reviews.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Big Sean, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
