        "biography": "Ram Bergman (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u05de\u05df) is an Israeli film producer. He is known for producing Brick (2005), The Brothers Bloom (2008), Looper (2012), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), and Knives Out (2019), all of which were written and directed by Rian Johnson.\n\nBergman received an Achievement in Film Award at the 2018 Israel Film Festival and was nominated for Outstanding Producer of Theatrical Motion Pictures for Knives Out at the 2020 Producers Guild of America Awards.\n\nBergman was born and raised in Rishon LeZion, Israel, to a Jewish family.\n\nBergman first began producing films during his early 20s, having moved from his native Rishon LeZion in Israel to initially New York and then Los Angeles, in 1991. He had no formal training, just a passion for the film industry and a willingness to keep at it. He worked as a valet, while also \u201ctrying to figure out how to make movies\u201d and within the year he was producing his first film, learning his trade while on the job.\n\nBergman met writer-director Rian Johnson while Johnson was attempting to make Brick. Bergman recalls: \"Rian had been trying to make this movie for seven years after he got out of school and when I read the script, I realized I'd never seen anything like this.\" With Bergman's help, Johnson was able to get the movie made for significantly less money. Describing their relationship, Bergman says \"You don\u2019t think when you start out what it could lead to. You just focus on making the movie, but today we are partners and I think I'll be the luckiest man if I can continue making movies with him for the rest of my life.\"\n\nBergman produced The Last Jedi (2017), the second film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. This again reunited him with Rian Johnson.\n\nIn September 2019, Johnson and Bergman launched the production company T-Street Productions that will generate original content for film and TV shows. The venture is fully capitalized by global media company Valence Media. T-Street launched with a first look deal with Valence Media's Media Rights Capital for film and television projects. Valence Media holds a substantial minority equity stake in the company. Johnson and Bergman intend to make their own original creations through the company, and produce others.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ram Bergman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
