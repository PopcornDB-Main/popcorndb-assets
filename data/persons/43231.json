        "biography": "Accomplished British actor Paul Blackthorne returned to primetime TV fall 2012 as determined Detective Quentin Lance on the CW\u2019s hit series \u2018Arrow\u2019.  This role follows that of manipulative reality show producer Clark Quietly in ABC\u2019s paranormal thriller \u2018The River\u2019. Recently he has also appeared opposite Ted Danson in \u2018CSI\u2019 and Callie Thorne in \u2018Necessary Roughness\u2019.\n\nBlackthorne was born in Shropshire, England, 1969. Blackthorne had his first acting experience at the age of 12 with the National Youth Music Theatre at the Edinburgh festival in 1981. Later he went on to study the Spiritual Psychology of Acting in London from 1996-98 before earning his first roles in British TV and film.\n\nIn 2000 he found himself in India portraying the villainous Captain Russell in the Oscar-nominated film \u2018Lagaan\u2019. The Oscar campaign brought him to Los Angeles where he went on to appear in many American TV shows including \u201824\u2019, \u2018ER\u2019, \u2018The Dresden Files\u2019, \u2018Lipstick Jungle\u2019, \u2018Deadwood\u2019 and \u2018Burn Notice\u2019. On the feature side, he has appeared in \u2018Four corners of suburbia, \u2018Special\u2019 and \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d\n\nAlongside acting Blackthorne spent much of the 90\u2019s traveling the world and exhibiting his photography in London. His first exhibition entitled \u2018Fish Heads and other things\u2019 raised money for Greenpeace. Another, \u2018Bollywood Backpack\u2019 raised money for the Gujarat Indian earthquake victims.\n\nThe last exhibition he held, \u2018Delhi to Manhattan\u2019, took place at Tibet House, New York in April 2009. This exhibition (view here) chronicles a journey through India trekking in the Himalayan-Tibetan communities and meeting with the Dalai Lama in Dharmsala as part of \u2018The Missing Peace\u2019 project. Proceeds from this exhibition went to the Tibetan children\u2019s villages in India.\n\nRecently Paul completed a documentary he produced with acclaimed Australian photographer Mister Basquali entitled \u2018This American Journey\u2019. Blackthorne\u2019s directorial debut tells the story of the two men traveling across America interviewing everyday Americans about how they feel about the state of the country and their hopes for its future. Along the way, stereotypes are shattered and wisdom found in the most unexpected places.\n\nIn the meantime \u2018Arrow\u2019 was nominated for best new drama at the People\u2019s choice awards 2013, \u2018This American Journey\u2019 is being submitted to film festivals and in partnership with musician James Carrington, Blackthorne is releasing an innovative app called \u2018Forte\u2019 teaching children how to read music.",
