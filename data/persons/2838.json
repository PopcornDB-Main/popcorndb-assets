        "biography": "Chlo\u00eb Stevens Sevigny\u00a0(/\u02c8s\u025bv\u0259ni/\u00a0SEV-\u0259n-ee; born November 18, 1974) is an American actress. Known for her work in\u00a0independent films, often appearing in controversial or\u00a0experimental features, Sevigny has received\u00a0several accolades, including a\u00a0Golden Globe Award and a nomination for an\u00a0Academy Award.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Sevigny found work as a model and appeared in music videos for\u00a0Sonic Youth\u00a0and\u00a0The Lemonheads, which helped acquire her \"it girl\" status. In 1995, she made her film debut in\u00a0Kids and became a prominent performer in the independent film scene throughout the late 1990s, with roles in such films as 1996's\u00a0Trees Lounge. Sevigny\u00a0rose to prominence\u00a0with her portrayal of\u00a0Lana Tisdel\u00a0in the drama film\u00a0Boys Don't Cry\u00a0(1999), for which she received a nomination for the\u00a0Academy Award For Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Sevigny appeared in supporting parts in numerous independent films, including\u00a0American Psycho\u00a0(2000),\u00a0Demonlover(2002),\u00a0Party Monster\u00a0and\u00a0Dogville\u00a0(both 2003), and\u00a0The Brown Bunny\u00a0(2004). Her participation in the latter caused considerable controversy due to a scene in which she performed graphic, unsimulated\u00a0fellatio. From 2006 to 2011, Sevigny portrayed\u00a0Nicolette Grant\u00a0on the\u00a0HBO\u00a0series\u00a0Big Love, for which she won a Golden Globe Award for\u00a0Best Supporting Actress\u00a0in 2010. She also appeared in mainstream films such as\u00a0David Fincher's\u00a0Zodiac\u00a0(2007) and starred in numerous television projects, including the British series\u00a0Hit & Miss\u00a0(2012), and had supporting roles in\u00a0Portlandia\u00a0(2013), two seasons of\u00a0American Horror Story; and in the Netflix series\u00a0Bloodline\u00a0(2015\u20132017) and\u00a0Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u00a0(2024).\u00a0\n\nSevigny made her directorial debut in 2016 with the short film\u00a0Kitty. Her third film as a director, White Echo, competed for the\u00a0Short Film Palme d'Or\u00a0at the\u00a02019 Cannes Film Festival. She also has a career in fashion design concurrent with her acting work. Over the years, her\u00a0alternative fashion sense\u00a0has earned her a reputation as a\u00a0style icon.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
