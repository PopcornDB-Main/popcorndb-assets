        "biography": "Christina Milian (born Christine Mari\u00e9 Flores, September 26, 1981) is an American recording artist, actress, dancer, and model.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles when she was 13 years old, desiring to be an actress. By the age of 17, she had begun writing songs to help obtain a recording contract. She has released three studio albums, and is currently working on fourth studio album due for release in 2011. Her self-titled debut album was released in 2001, and features the singles \"AM to PM\" and \"When You Look at Me\"; both peaked in the top three on the UK Singles Chart. Her second studio album, It's About Time (2004), provided her first major US hit \"Dip It Low\". Her third studio album, So Amazin' (2006), produced only one single, \"Say I\". A month after the release of So Amazin', her representative confirmed that she had left Island Records due to creative differences. She signed with Interscope Records in 2009, through which she will release her album, Elope. A single, ballad \"Us Against the World\", was released in October 2008.\n\nAlthough she is best known for her singing career, she originally wanted to be an actress. Her first lead role was in the 2003 film Love Don't Cost a Thing, and subsequently had main roles in Be Cool and the horror film Pulse. She had a minor role in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, and starred as the lead role in the straight-to-DVD film Bring It On: Fight to the Finish. She has also starred in a number of TV movies.\n\nOn September 4, 2009, she and R&B singer/songwriter The-Dream eloped in Las Vegas, and she gave birth to their daughter, Violet, on February 26, 2010. She and The-Dream announced their separation on July 12, 2010.",
