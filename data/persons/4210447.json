She was working at a restaurant in Cornwall, where Curtis was filming his new comedy About Time, when she served the director and his family pizza. A month later she was shocked to be offered a small but important role \u2014 as a restaurant worker. Chew, 18, who had just finished studying for a singing diploma, was offered the part because she was \u201cso sweet\u201d, Curtis said at the launch of the time-travel comedy in St Austell, Cornwall. \u201cThis was just typical of the reception we received \u2014 people were so nice that we wanted to take them with us.\u201d",
