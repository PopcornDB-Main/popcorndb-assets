During the 1960s you could catch him on numerous shows from Mission Impossible to The Man From Uncle.

In 1967, as a prison guard he addresses Robert Blake as he is about to be hung in the classic In Cold Blood. And he was a cop that helps chase Kevin McCarthy back in the 50s with Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.",
