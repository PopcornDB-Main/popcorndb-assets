By the time he had turned ten he was a popular child star and had appeared in 52 films. Moore continued as a child star for many more years, and was the actor who gave Shirley Temple\u00a0her first romantic screen kiss when that honor was bestowed upon him in 1942's\u00a0Miss Annie Rooney.\n\nAs with many child actors, once Moore got older the roles began to dry up. He made his final film in 1950, but was still in the public eye with the 1949 to 1955 television series\u00a0Captain Video and His Video Rangers\u00a0(1949). He then retired from acting for a new career in publicity.\n\nMoore died, age 89, in 2015.",
