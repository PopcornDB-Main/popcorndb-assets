        "biography": "Val\u00e9rie Bonneton (born 5 April 1970) is a French stage, film and television actress.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Bonneton was born in Somain, Nord department. Her father was an insurance salesman and her mother a housewife. She grew up in neighbouring Aniche and fell in love with acting in her cinqui\u00e8me (~Year 7) French class. Considering an acting career too difficult, she entered the science stream for her baccalaur\u00e9at, intending to become a veterinarian. But playing the role of Ism\u00e8ne in Anouilh\u2019s Antigone changed her mind. After her baccalaur\u00e9at she left for Paris where she enrolled at Cours Florent, supporting herself with part-time jobs (fruit seller, baby-sitter, sculptor\u2019s model). In 1991 she was accepted into the National Academy of Dramatic Arts where she studied until the age of 26.\n\nShe took noteworthy supporting roles in films, until the success of the television series Fais pas ci, fais pas \u00e7a in 2007, which made her popular. In 2010, she appeared in Guillaume Canet\u2019s Little White Lies which earnt her a C\u00e9sar Awards nomination as Best Supporting Actress. In 2013, she appeared in Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull with Dany Boon. In 2017, she acted in Garde altern\u00e9e with Didier Bourdon and Isabelle Carr\u00e9.\n\nSource: Article \"Val\u00e9rie Bonneton\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
