        "biography": "Jennifer Lynn Lopez\u00a0(born July 24, 1969), also known as\u00a0J.Lo, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, dancer and businesswoman. Lopez is regarded as one of the most influential Latin entertainers of her time, credited with breaking barriers for\u00a0Latino Americans\u00a0in\u00a0Hollywood\u00a0and helping propel the\u00a0Latin pop movement\u00a0in music. She is also noted for impacting popular culture\u00a0through fashion,\u00a0branding, and shifting\u00a0mainstream beauty standards.\n\nLopez began her career as a dancer, making her television debut as a\u00a0Fly Girl\u00a0on the\u00a0sketch comedy\u00a0series\u00a0In Living Color\u00a0in 1991. She rose to fame as an actress, starring as singer\u00a0Selena in the\u00a0film of the same name\u00a0(1997), and established herself as the highest-paid Latin actress, with leading roles in\u00a0Anaconda\u00a0(1997) and\u00a0Out of Sight\u00a0(1998). Lopez successfully ventured into the music industry with her debut album,\u00a0On the 6\u00a0(1999). In 2001, she became the first woman to simultaneously have a number-one album and film in the United States, with her second album,\u00a0J.Lo, and the\u00a0romantic comedy The Wedding Planner. She has since become known for starring in romantic comedies, including\u00a0Maid in Manhattan\u00a0(2002),\u00a0Shall We Dance?\u00a0(2004), and\u00a0Monster-in-Law\u00a0(2005). Lopez released two albums in 2002:\u00a0J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes\u00a0and\u00a0This Is Me... Then, the former became the first remix album to top the US\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200.\n\nMedia scrutiny and the failure of her film\u00a0Gigli (2003) preceded a career downturn. Her subsequent albums included\u00a0Rebirth\u00a0(2005) and\u00a0Como Ama una Mujer\u00a0(2007); the latter broke first-week sales records for a debut Spanish album. Lopez returned to prominence as a judge on\u00a0American Idol\u00a0(2011\u20132016). With the album\u00a0Love?\u00a0(2011), she has remained musically active since then. Throughout the 2010s, she\u00a0voiced Shira\u00a0in the animated\u00a0Ice Age\u00a0franchise\u00a0(2012\u20132016), starred in the\u00a0police drama\u00a0series\u00a0Shades of Blue\u00a0(2016\u20132018), and served as a judge on\u00a0World of Dance\u00a0(2017\u20132020). In 2019, she garnered critical praise for her performance in the crime drama\u00a0Hustlers. Lopez continued her acting career with leading roles in the films\u00a0Marry Me\u00a0(2022),\u00a0The Mother\u00a0(2023),\u00a0This Is Me... Now: A Love Story,\u00a0Atlas\u00a0(2024), and\u00a0Kiss of the Spider Woman\u00a0(2025).\n\nWith over 80 million records sold worldwide, Lopez has earned four US\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100 number-one singles and two\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0number-one albums. Her\u00a0accolades\u00a0include a Hollywood Walk of Fame star, the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Icon Award, three\u00a0American Music Awards, four\u00a0MTV Video Music Awards\u00a0(including the\u00a0Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award), and six\u00a0Guinness World Records. She has been ranked among the\u00a0100 most influential people in the world\u00a0by\u00a0Time\u00a0(2016) and the\u00a0World's 100 Most Powerful Women\u00a0by\u00a0Forbes\u00a0(2012). Lopez has a large social media following and is among the\u00a0most-followed individuals\u00a0on\u00a0Instagram. Her other ventures include a\u00a0lifestyle brand, beauty and fashion lines, fragrances, a\u00a0production company, and a\u00a0charitable foundation.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jennifer Lopez, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
