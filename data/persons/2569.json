        "biography": "V\u00e9ra Gibson-Amado, known professionally as V\u00e9ra Clouzot, (30 December 1913 \u2013 15 December 1960) was a Brazilian-French film actress and screenwriter. She is known for playing Linda in The Wages of Fear (1953), Christina Delassalle in Les Diaboliques (1955), and Lucie in Les Espions (1957). Clouzot also co-wrote the screenplay for La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 (1960). Her husband, director Henri-Georges Clouzot, named his production company after her, V\u00e9ra Films.\n\nClouzot was born V\u00e9ra Gibson-Amado in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Alice do Rego Barros and Gilberto Amado, a Brazilian congressman, writer, journalist, lawyer and ex-President of the United Nations' International Law Committee. Writer Jorge Amado was her second cousin.\n\nIn 1941, V\u00e9ra met French actor L\u00e9o Lapara, a member of the theater company of Louis Jouvet who toured in Brazil during World War II. Vera married the actor, taking part in the company's South American tour that lasted almost four years.\n\nAfter World War II, Vera settled in Paris. Louis Jouvet took over the direction of the Athen\u00e9e Theater, while she continued to do small roles.\n\nV\u00e9ra met film director Henri-Georges Clouzot through her then-husband, L\u00e9o Lapara, who had minor parts in Quai des Orf\u00e8vres (1947) and Return to Life (1949), in the segment directed by Clouzot, \"Le Retour de Jean\".\n\nV\u00e9ra worked as a continuity assistant on Clouzot's Miquette (1950), and they married in 1950. Clouzot named his production company, V\u00e9ra Films, after his wife. She made only three films, all directed by her husband. The sole female role in The Wages of Fear (1953), Linda, is played by V\u00e9ra. Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife, as the character does not exist in the original novel. The Wages of Fear is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire. The Wages of Fear was the 4th highest-grossing film in France in 1953, and was seen by nearly 7 million spectators.\n\nThe most notable of Clouzot's films starring V\u00e9ra was the classic thriller, Les Diaboliques (1955), co-starring Simone Signoret. She also starred in Les Espions (1957), and co-wrote the screenplay for the film La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 (1960), which was also directed by her husband.\n\nClouzot and V\u00e9ra took a film crew with them to V\u00e9ra's homeland in Brazil for their honeymoon, where Clouzot made his first attempt at directing a documentary film. The Brazilian government took issue with Clouzot filming the poverty of people in the favelas rather than the more picturesque parts of Brazil. The film was never finished because the costs became too high. Clouzot became fascinated with the region and wrote a book, Le cheval des dieux, recounting his trip.\n\nV\u00e9ra died in Paris in 1960, aged 46, from a heart attack, shortly after the filming of La V\u00e9rit\u00e9. Henri-Georges Clouzot fell into a depression over her death. After her funeral, he moved to Tahiti, but returned to France in December 1961. She is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris.\n\nSource: Article \"V\u00e9ra Clouzot\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
