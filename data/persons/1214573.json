Regarded as one of the best players in the world, she earned her first grand slam singles title at the U.S. Open back in 1999, and made a string of four straight grand slam singles title wins - the 2002 French, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open titles, and the 2003 Australian Open title, all achieved by defeating her older sister, Venus. A knee injury in 2003 forced her to sit out 8 months of tennis competition. She reached the Wimbledon final in 2004, but has not won a major title since the summer of 2003.  Williams has also appeared in guest roles on The\u00a0Simpsons\u00a0and\u00a0My Wife and Kids, as well as the films Pixels (2015), Ocean\u2019s 8 (2018), and Glass Onion (2022). The 2021 film King Richard, which she served as an executive producer on, is based on her and her sister\u2019s early careers.",
