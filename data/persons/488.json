        "biography": "Steven Allan Spielberg\u00a0(born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. A major figure of the\u00a0New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern\u00a0blockbuster, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the greatest film directors of all time and is the most\u00a0commercially successful director in film history. Several of Spielberg's works are considered among the greatest films in history, and some are among the highest-grossing films ever.\n\nSpielberg was born in\u00a0Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in\u00a0Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to\u00a0California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including\u00a0Night Gallery\u00a0and\u00a0Columbo, he directed the film\u00a0Duel (1971), which Barry Diller approved. He made his theatrical debut with\u00a0The Sugarland Express\u00a0(1974) and became a household name with the summer blockbuster\u00a0Jaws\u00a0(1975). He directed more\u00a0escapist\u00a0box office successes with\u00a0Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u00a0(1977),\u00a0E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\u00a0(1982) and the original\u00a0Indiana Jones\u00a0trilogy (1981\u20131989). He explored drama in\u00a0The Color Purple\u00a0(1985) and\u00a0Empire of the Sun\u00a0(1987).\n\nIn 1993, Spielberg directed the science fiction thriller\u00a0Jurassic Park, the\u00a0highest-grossing film ever, and the\u00a0epic\u00a0historical drama Schindler's List, which has often been listed as one of the\u00a0greatest films ever made. He won the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Director\u00a0for the latter and the World War II epic\u00a0Saving Private Ryan\u00a0(1998). Spielberg has since directed the science fiction films\u00a0A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001),\u00a0Minority Report\u00a0(2002),\u00a0War of the Worlds (2005) and\u00a0Ready Player One\u00a0(2018); the historical dramas\u00a0Amistad\u00a0(1997),\u00a0Munich\u00a0(2005),\u00a0War Horse\u00a0(2011),\u00a0Lincoln\u00a0(2012),\u00a0Bridge of Spies (2015) and\u00a0The Post\u00a0(2017); the comedies\u00a0Catch Me if You Can\u00a0(2002), and\u00a0The Terminal\u00a0(2004); the animated film\u00a0The Adventures of Tintin\u00a0(2011); the musical\u00a0West Side Story\u00a0(2021); and the family drama\u00a0The Fabelmans\u00a0(2022).\n\nSpielberg co-founded\u00a0Amblin Entertainment\u00a0and\u00a0DreamWorks and has produced many successful films and television series, including\u00a0Poltergeist\u00a0(1982),\u00a0Gremlins\u00a0(1984),\u00a0Back to the Future\u00a0(1985),\u00a0Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u00a0(1988), and\u00a0Band of Brothers\u00a0(2001). He has also collaborated extensively with the composer\u00a0John Williams, with whom he has worked on all but five of his feature films.\n\nAmong other\u00a0accolades, he has received three\u00a0Academy Awards, four\u00a0Golden Globe Awards\u00a0and two\u00a0BAFTA Awards, as well as the\u00a0AFI Life Achievement Award\u00a0in 1995, the\u00a0Knight Commander\u00a0of the British Empire in 2001, the\u00a0Kennedy Center Honor\u00a0in 2006, the\u00a0Cecil B. DeMille Award\u00a0in 2009 and the\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 2015. Seven of\u00a0his films\u00a0have been inducted into the\u00a0National Film Registry\u00a0by the\u00a0Library of Congress\u00a0as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\u00a0In 2013,\u00a0Time\u00a0listed him as one of the\u00a0100 most influential\u00a0people,\u00a0and in 2023, Spielberg was the recipient of the first-ever\u00a0100 Impact Award\u00a0in the US.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steven Spielberg, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
