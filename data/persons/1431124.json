She is the first model of East Asian descent to walk the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, the first spokesmodel of East Asian descent for Est\u00e9e Lauder and the first Asian model to ever make Forbes magazine's annual highest-paid models list. In 2012, The New York Times named her \"China\u2019s first bona fide supermodel\".\n\nIn an April 2014 article about social media's rise in the fashion industry, American Vogue remarked that she had \"by far, the biggest social-media audience of any model\". Models.com dubbed her as the first ever Asian \"New Supermodel\" in July 2014. And in October of the same year, Liu became the first person in the world to showcase an Apple Watch on a magazine cover when she appeared on Vogue China's November 2014 issue.\n\nIn April 2015, she and South Korean singer Choi Siwon participated in a Chinese spin-off of the South Korean variety show We Got Married.
