        "biography": "Sammee Tong (April 21, 1901 \u2013 October 27, 1964) was an American film and television character actor. He was best known for his starring role as John Forsythe's live-in houseboy/valet Peter Tong on the sitcom Bachelor Father, which aired on all three national networks from 1957 to 1962.\n\nTong signed with Columbia Pictures, and made his film debut in a bit part in the comedy film The Captain Hates the Sea (1934). In 1939 he returned to his home town as director of entertainment at the Chinese Village of San Francisco's World's Fair, and began the first Chinese radio hour on KSAN. Throughout the 1940s, he had small, usually uncredited, roles in films. He returned to Hollywood in the early 1950s and took roles on television.\n\nTong made his television debut in a 1953 episode of You Are There. He had a recurring role as George the cook the first two seasons of the Mickey Mouse Club serial The Adventures of Spin and Marty (1955 - 1956). In 1957, he landed a co-starring role in the sitcom Bachelor Father, starring John Forsythe and Noreen Corcoran. In the series, Tong portrayed \"Peter Tong\", Bentley Gregg's (Forsythe) live-in houseboy and valet. Although he was playing a servant, Tong enjoyed the role stating, \"Houseboys in movies and the theater always bow low, mutter a few sing song words and disappear, but not on this show. I get dialogue and laughs.\"  After Bachelor Father's cancellation in 1962, Tong was cast as Sammy Ling in the ABC sitcom Mickey (1964 - 1965), starring Mickey Rooney. Despite low ratings, Tong's character had a solid fanbase thanks to his role in Bachelor Father. Tong's death effectively ended any chance for the series' survival, and ABC canceled Mickey in its first season.\n\nHis final screen appearance was as \"Cook\" in the film Fluffy (1965), starring Tony Randall and Shirley Jones.  The film was released after Tong's death in October 1964 from an intentional barbiturate overdose.",
