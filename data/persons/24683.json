        "biography": "Jacques Weber is a French actor, director and writer.\n\nWeber joined the Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur d'art dramatique at the age of 20, and won the Prix d'Excellence when he left. He joined Robert Hossein in Rheims, and began a rich theatrical career and a sporadic cinema career.\n\nMarcel Cravenne hired him in 1970 for Tartuffe. In 1972, he was Haroun in Faustine et le Bel \u00c9t\u00e9 and played the role of Hugo in \u00c9tat de si\u00e8ge by Costa-Gavras. He was seduced by Claude Jade in Le Malin Plaisir (1975), and by Anic\u00e9e Alvina in Une femme fatale (1976). The young actor with much sex-appeal (he appeared in Le Malin Plaisir completely naked) was in Bel Ami (1983) after the 1885 novel by Guy de Maupassant in the adaptation by Pierre Cardinal. On television, he was, among others, Le Comte de Monte-Cristo by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re and Judge Antoine Rives in the show by Gilles B\u00e9hat. Noticeable on film as Comte de Guiche in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) and Don Juan (1998), where he seduces Emmanuelle B\u00e9art. In 2008, he joined Isabelle Adjani in a televised adaptation of Figaro which he directed for France 3.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1985, he appeared at the Centre dramatique national in Lyon (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du 8th), and from 1986 to 2001, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Nice, Centre dramatique national Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur. He has starred and directed in many of the great roles of classical theatre, including Cyrano, where he excelled for many seasons.\n\nJacques Weber published Des petits coins de paradis in October 2009, his first work, which relates to his work as an artist and his friends.\n\nHe is married to Christine Weber and has three children: two sons, Tommy and Stanley, and one daughter, Kim.\n\nSource: Article \"Jacques Weber\" from Wikipedia in english, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
