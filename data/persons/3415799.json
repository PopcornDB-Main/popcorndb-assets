The misfit trio upends convention at every turn, be it through choreographed dances in caf\u00e9s or frolicsome romps through the Louvre. Eventually, their romantic view of outlaws pushes them to plan their own heist, but their inexperience may send them out in a blaze of glory -- which could be just what they want.",
