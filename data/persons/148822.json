Wright came to the studio in the 1940s, and became well  known throughout the ensuing decades for his endearingly gloomy and  sullen personality traits as well as his bass voice. He turned out to be  a natural model for Eeyore when the studio began development on Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree.  He, along with his fellow Disney contemporaries, was a pioneer in the  use of \"gags\" within cartoons, often acted out in front of the \"story  board,\" a bulletin board pinned with sequential sketches of the  cartoon's scenes. This technique is still in use today in most major  animation studios. He spent the last 30 years of his life in San Luis Obispo County in Los Osos. He died at his home in Los Osos, CA from a heart attack. -Wikipedia",
