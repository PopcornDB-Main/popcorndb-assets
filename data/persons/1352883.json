In these conditions, there was no question of studying to become an actress, of going through conservatories: \"My parents did not have the means to allow me to continue school; my father, at the port, did not bring in tokens every days: I wanted to find work to help my parents. I started as a typist, says Fettouma, but, from my childhood, my goal was to do theater, and I wanted to deepen my cultural level for that.\" Here she is, a singer; Mustapha Kateb, then director of the Algerian National Theater, encouraged him; and also the playwrights Kaki and Abdelkader Sefiri. She debuted on stage in \"L'Oiseau Vert\", in 1963, an adaptation of Gozzi's play; secondly, it is a creation of a social nature. \u201cTwo Rooms Kitchen\u201d; then \u201cThe Caucasian Chalk Circle\u201d, by Brecht, and \u201cThe Man with the Rubber Sandals\u201d, by Kateb Yacine; finally, two other creations: \u201cThe Blood of the Righteous\u201d (on the armed revolution) and a \u201cRevizor\u201d, inspired by Gogol, on bureaucracy. All these shows were performed in dialect Arabic.\n\nThe film \"Premier Pas\" by Mohamed Bouamari (1979) earned the actress Fettouma Ousliha-Bouamari, his partner in life, the Interpretation prize at Carthage 1980.",
