        "biography": "James Eugene Carrey\u00a0is a Canadian-American actor and comedian primarily known for his energetic\u00a0slapstick\u00a0performances.\u00a0After spending the 1980s honing his comedy act and playing supporting roles in films, Carrey gained recognition when he was cast in the American\u00a0sketch comedy\u00a0television series\u00a0In Living Color(1990\u20131994). He broke out as a film star after starring in a string of box office hits, such as\u00a0Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,\u00a0The Mask,\u00a0Dumb and Dumber\u00a0(all 1994),\u00a0Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, and\u00a0Batman Forever\u00a0(both 1995). The success of these five films led to Carrey being the first comic actor to receive an upfront $20 million salary for performing in films, beginning with\u00a0The Cable Guy\u00a0(1996).\n\nHe continued to have success as a leading actor in comedies such as\u00a0Liar Liar\u00a0(1997),\u00a0How the Grinch Stole Christmas\u00a0(2000),\u00a0Bruce Almighty(2003),\u00a0Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\u00a0(2004), and\u00a0Yes Man\u00a0(2008). Since the 2010s, Carrey appeared in fewer films, with notable works including\u00a0Dumb and Dumber To(2014) and his role as\u00a0Doctor Eggman\u00a0in the\u00a0Sonic the Hedgehog\u00a0film series\u00a0(2020\u2013present).\n\nAlthough largely\u00a0typecast\u00a0as a comedic actor, Carrey had success in dramatic roles. His critically acclaimed performances include the title role in\u00a0The Truman Show\u00a0(1998) and\u00a0Andy Kaufman\u00a0in\u00a0Man on the Moon\u00a0(1999), winning\u00a0Golden Globe Awards\u00a0for each film. He starred in the romantic drama film\u00a0Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind(2004), for which he was nominated for a\u00a0BAFTA Award\u00a0and another Golden Globe. Carrey also starred in the\u00a0Showtime\u00a0tragicomedy\u00a0series\u00a0Kidding\u00a0(2018\u20132020), for which he received his seventh Golden Globe nomination.",
