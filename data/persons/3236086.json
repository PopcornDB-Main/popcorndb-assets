Her mom saw her need to perform and registered her in ballet at the age of 5. Ballet taught and instilled discipline, the importance of hard work, and to consistently bring your \"A\" game. She performed in ballet for 10 years in shows like the Nutcracker and Swan Lake with Canadian Dance World. Even now Susan takes ballet class just for fun. At the age of 13 Susan was discovered by a modeling agent, and soon was accepting local modeling jobs in Vancouver and print work in New York.\n\nRealizing acting was her passion, she returned to Vancouver and started a summer intensive program at the William Davis Center. She has had the opportunity to work with and learn from many seasoned actors in t.v. and film, including Ann Hathaway, Kirstin Davis, Seth Rogen, Robin Dunne and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to name a few.",
