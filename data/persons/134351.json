Born in Tokyo into the aristocratic Higashib\u014dj\u014d family (her birth name was Hideko Higashib\u014dj\u014d (\u6771\u574a\u57ce \u82f1\u5b50 Higashib\u014dj\u014d Hideko)), she graduated from Bunka Gakuin before debuting as an actress at Nikkatsu in 1927. She became a major star, even starting her own production company, Irie Productions, in 1932. One of Kenji Mizoguchi's silent film masterpieces, The Water Magician, was produced at that company with Irie starring. She appeared in many advertisements, as well as on fans and other commercial goods. Irie was also the subject of a folding screen painting by Nihonga artist Nakamura Daizabur\u014d, which appeared in the 1930 Teiten (Imperial Exhibition), and which is today in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art; toy dolls were also produced based on this image.\n\nIn the postwar period, Irie became known as a \"ghost cat actress\" (bakeneko joy\u016b) for appearing in a series of kaidan (ghost story) movies. One of her late memorable roles was in Akira Kurosawa's Sanjuro, where she plays Mutsuta's wife, the lady who warns Sanjuro (Toshir\u014d Mifune) that \"the best sword stays in its scabbard\".",
