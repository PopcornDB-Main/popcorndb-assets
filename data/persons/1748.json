        "biography": "William Shatner,\u00a0OC\u00a0is a Canadian actor. In a career spanning seven decades, he is best known for his portrayal of\u00a0James T. Kirk\u00a0in the\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0franchise, from his 1966 debut as the captain of the starship\u00a0Enterprise\u00a0in the\u00a0second pilot\u00a0of the\u00a0first\u00a0Star Trek television series\u00a0to his final appearance as Captain Kirk in the seventh\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0feature film,\u00a0Star Trek Generations\u00a0(1994).\n\nShatner began his screen acting career in Canadian films and television productions before moving into guest-starring roles in various American television shows. He appeared as James Kirk in all the episodes of\u00a0Star Trek: The Original Series, 21 of the 22 episodes of\u00a0Star Trek: The Animated Series, and the first seven\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0movies. He has written a series of books chronicling his experiences before, during and after his time in a\u00a0Starfleet\u00a0uniform. He has also co-written several novels set in the\u00a0Star Trek universe and a series of science fiction novels, the\u00a0TekWar\u00a0sequence, that were adapted for television. Outside\u00a0Star Trek,\u00a0Shatner played the eponymous veteran police sergeant in\u00a0T. J. Hooker\u00a0(1982\u20131986), hosted the reality-based television series\u00a0Rescue 911\u00a0(1989\u20131996), guest starred on the detective series\u00a0Columbo, and acted in the comedy film\u00a0Miss Congeniality (2000).\n\nAfter his last appearance as Captain Kirk, Shatner's television career has embraced comedy, drama and reality shows. In seasons 4 and 5 of the\u00a0NBC\u00a0series\u00a03rd Rock from the Sun, he played the alien \"Big Giant Head\", to which the main characters reported. From 2004 until 2008, he starred as attorney\u00a0Denny Crane\u00a0in the final season of the legal show\u00a0The Practice\u00a0and in its spinoff\u00a0Boston Legal, a role that earned him two\u00a0Emmy Awards, one for his contribution to each series. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, he starred in both seasons of NBC's\u00a0Better Late Than Never, a comical travel series in which a band of elderly celebrities toured East Asia and Europe.\n\nAside from acting, Shatner has had a career as a recording artist, beginning in 1968 with his album\u00a0The Transformed Man. His cover versions of songs are\u00a0dramatic recitations\u00a0of their lyrics rather than musical performances: the most notable are his versions of\u00a0the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\",\u00a0Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", and\u00a0Elton John's \"Rocket Man\".\u00a0His most successful album was his third,\u00a0Seeking Major Tom\u00a0(2011), which includes covers of\u00a0Pink Floyd's \"Learning to Fly\",\u00a0David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" and\u00a0Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\n\nIn 2021, Shatner flew into space aboard\u00a0Blue Origin NS-18, a\u00a0Blue Origin\u00a0sub-orbital capsule. At age 90, he became the oldest person to fly in space and one of the first 600 to do so. Minutes after the flight, he described experiencing the\u00a0overview effect.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article William Shatner, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
