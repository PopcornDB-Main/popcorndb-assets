        "biography": "Emily Jean \"Emma\" Stone (born November 6, 1988, Scottsdale, Arizona) is an American actress and producer whose dynamic performances have reshaped contemporary cinema. With two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards, she is a leading figure in global filmmaking. Her career began at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre with The Wind in the Willows (2000). At fifteen, she moved to Los Angeles, debuting in an unsold television pilot, In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004). Stone gained recognition through teen comedies like Superbad (2007), Zombieland (2009), and Easy A (2010), her first starring role, earning a Golden Globe nomination. Her roles in Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and The Help (2011) highlighted her versatility, while The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and its 2014 sequel elevated her global profile.\n\nStone earned Oscar nominations for Birdman (2014) and The Favourite (2018), winning Best Actress for La La Land (2016) and Poor Things (2023). She starred in Battle of the Sexes (2017), Cruella (2021), and Maniac (2018). In 2020, she co-founded Fruit Tree, producing films like Problemista (2023).\n\nStone's collaboration with Yorgos Lanthimos, inspired by her admiration for his films like The Lobster (2015) and Dogtooth (2009), spans The Favourite, Poor Things, and Kinds of Kindness (2024). This partnership, driven by her trust in his vision, reflects her deliberate shift toward experimental cinema over mainstream Hollywood projects.",
