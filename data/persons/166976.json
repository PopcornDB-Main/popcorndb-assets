The grand daughter of Sam Tennor, a song plugger for Irving Berlin, Tennor made her film debut playing a twelve-year old boy in Hal Hartey\u2019s Amateur which premiered in the Directors Fortnight at Cannes. She works regularly in television and film, and is most known for her recurring role on AMC\u2019s Mad Men as Betty Draper\u2019s frank-talking friend Joyce Darling, as well as John Goodman\u2019s dutiful if not impish secretary in Michel Hazanavicius\u2019s Academy Award winning film, The Artist. She made her writing debut with StripSearch, her one-woman show based on her studies in pole dancing with Sheila Kelley at her SFactor Studio which played to rave reviews in Los Angeles for over a year and a half. In 2013, Tennor made her foray into producing assisting Doug Blake (The Sessions) on Smothered, a film by John Schneider, where she met Cracked Co-Producer & First AD, David Dwiggins who helped guide her through her directorial debut. Her feature project, Never Been Born, has been selected as one of ten finalists in the Nantucket Film Festival's Tony Cox Screenplay Contest and is in Pre-Production, starring Dale Dickey, Thomas Sadoski and Annika Marks.",
