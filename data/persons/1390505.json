Since graduating Kyle has garnered excellent reviews for his stage work in 'The Government Inspector' at the Young Vic, 'The Faith Machine' at the Royal Court and 'Long Day's Journey into Night' at the Apollo, as well as playing Gaveston in the National's controversial 'Edward II'. On television he contributed an excellent cameo in the sitcom 'Bad Education' as an all-American boy who was actually from Dudley in the Midlands and played sympathetic but troubled Francis in the BBC remake of 'Poldark'.",
