        "biography": "Nicholas Jerry Jonas\u00a0(born September 16, 1992)\u00a0is an American singer, songwriter and actor. Jonas began acting on Broadway at the age of seven and released his debut single in 2002; this caught the attention of\u00a0Columbia Records, where Jonas formed a band with his older brothers\u00a0and\u00a0Joe, known as the\u00a0Jonas Brothers. The group released their debut studio album,\u00a0It's About Time, through the Columbia label in 2006. After leaving Columbia Records and signing with\u00a0Hollywood Records, the group released their\u00a0self-titled second studio album\u00a0in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the\u00a0Disney Channel\u00a0during this time, gaining a large following through the network, and appeared in the widely successful musical television film\u00a0Camp Rock\u00a0(2008) and its sequel\u00a0Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\u00a0(2010), as well as two of their series,\u00a0Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream\u00a0(2008\u20132010) and\u00a0Jonas\u00a0(2009\u20132010).\n\nThe band's third studio album,\u00a0A Little Bit Longer(2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single, \"Burnin' Up\", hit the top five on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100\u00a0chart. Following the release of their fourth studio album,\u00a0Lines, Vines and Trying Times\u00a0(2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus. Jonas formed a new band known as\u00a0Nick Jonas & the Administration, who released the album\u00a0Who I Am\u00a0in 2010. Afterwards, Jonas shifted his focus to acting. He had a recurring role on the television series\u00a0Smash\u00a0and some Broadway shows.\n\nAfter the group's official disbandment in 2013, Jonas began work on his second solo studio album, signing with\u00a0Island Records\u00a0and releasing\u00a0Nick Jonas\u00a0through the label in 2014, which saw the commercial success of the single \"Jealous\". Jonas later co-founded\u00a0Safehouse Records, a record label in conjunction with the Island and Hollywood labels. His third studio album, Last Year Was Complicated\u00a0(2016), peaked at number two on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0chart in the United States. Jonas won the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Hal David Starlight Award in 2016 following the release.\u00a0In 2017, Jonas appeared in the adventure comedy film\u00a0Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which became the\u00a0fifth highest-grossing film of the year. The Jonas Brothers reformed in early 2019 and released the album\u00a0Happiness Begins\u00a0in June of that year. Jonas' fourth solo studio album,\u00a0Spaceman, was released on March 12, 2021.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Nick Jonas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
