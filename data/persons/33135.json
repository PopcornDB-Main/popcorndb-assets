From 1928 to 1992 he appeared in at least 155 films, including Ozu's Tokyo Story (1953) and Yoshitaro Nomura's Castle of Sand (1974). From 1969 until his death, Ryu became familiar to a new generation as the curmudgeonly but benevolent Buddhist priest in Yoji Yamada's Tora-san movie series (a role he parodied to great effect in a cameo in Juzo Itami's 1984 comedy, The Funeral).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Chish\u00fb Ry\u00fb, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.\u200b",
