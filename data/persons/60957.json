He led his teams to first place eleven times over his 21-year baseball career and had only two losing seasons. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nHe was nicknamed \"Mr. October\" for his\u00a0clutch hitting\u00a0in the postseason with the Athletics and the Yankees.\u00a0He helped Oakland win five consecutive\u00a0American League West\u00a0divisional titles, three straight\u00a0American League pennants\u00a0and three consecutive\u00a0World Series\u00a0titles from\u00a01972\u00a0to\u00a01974.\u00a0He helped New York win four American League East\u00a0divisional pennants, three American League pennants and back to back World Series titles, in\u00a01977\u00a0and\u00a01978. He also helped the\u00a0California Angels\u00a0win two AL West divisional titles in\u00a01982\u00a0and\u00a01986. He hit three consecutive home runs at\u00a0Yankee Stadium\u00a0in the clinching game six of the\u00a01977 World Series.\n\nHe hit 563 career\u00a0home runs\u00a0and was an\u00a0American League\u00a0(AL)\u00a0All-Star\u00a0for 14 seasons. He won two\u00a0Silver Slugger Awards, the AL\u00a0Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award\u00a0in 1973, two\u00a0World Series MVP Awards\u00a0and the\u00a0Babe Ruth Award\u00a0in 1977. The Yankees retired his uniform number in 1993, and the Athletics retired it in 2004.\u00a0He currently serves as a special advisor to the\u00a0Houston Astros, and a sixth championship associated with him came with Houston's win in the\u00a02022 World Series.\n\nHe was the de facto spokesperson for the\u00a0Upper Deck Company\u00a0during the early 1990s, appearing in numerous advertisements, appearances, and participating in the company's Heroes of Baseball exhibition games.\n\nHe has endured three fires to personal property, including a June 20, 1976, fire at his home in Oakland that destroyed his 1973 MVP award, World Series trophies and All-Star rings.\u00a0The same home was again burned down during the\u00a0Oakland firestorm of 1991, which destroyed more baseball memorabilia in addition to other valuable collections.\u00a0In 1988, a warehouse holding several of Jackson's collectible cars was damaged in a fire, with several of the cars, valued at $3.2 million (~$8 million in 2022 terms) ruined.\n\nHe co-authored a book in 2010,\u00a0Sixty-Feet Six-Inches, with fellow Hall of Famer\u00a0Bob Gibson. The book, whose title refers to the distance between the pitcher's mound and home plate, details their careers and approach to the game.",
