Orangey the Cat is the only feline double-winner of the Patsy Award, the animal kingdom's equivalent of the Oscar. The Patsy Award is given out by the American Humane Association's Hollywood branch and stands for Picture Animal Top Star of the Year. Orangey won his first Patsy for his cinema debut in\u00a0Rhubarb (1951), playing the eponymous baseball team-owning cat in the 1951 film. Ten years later, he won his second Patsy, playing \"Cat\" in\u00a0Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), a homeless feline described as a \"poor slob without a name\" by Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), whom he visits.\n\nOrangey's longest gig was a recurring role as Minerva the Cat in the TV series\u00a0Our Miss Brooks (1952)\u00a0from 1952 through 1958.",
