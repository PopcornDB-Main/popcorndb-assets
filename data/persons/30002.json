        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGuy Bridges Kibbee (March 6, 1882 \u2013 May 24, 1956) was an American stage and film actor.\n\nBorn in El Paso, Texas, Kibbee began his entertainment career on Mississippi riverboats and eventually became a successful Broadway actor. In the 1930s, Kibbee moved to California and became part of what became known as \"Warner Bros.' stock company\", contracted actors who cycled through different productions in supporting roles. Kibbee's specialty was daft and jovial characters and he is best remembered for the films 42nd Street (1933), The Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), Captain Blood (1935), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), though he gives a deftly subtle performance as the expat inn owner in Joan Crawford's Rain (1932).\n\nKibbee died from complications arising from Parkinson's disease in Long Island, New York in 1956.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Guy Kibbee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
