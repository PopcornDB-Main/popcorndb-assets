        "biography": "Nathalie Marie Andr\u00e9e Baye (born 6 July 1948) is a French film, television, and stage actress. She began her career in 1970 and has appeared in more than 80 films. A ten-time C\u00e9sar Award nominee, her four wins were for Every Man for Himself (1980), Strange Affair (1981), La Balance (1982), and The Young Lieutenant (2005). Her other films include Day for Night (1973), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Tell No One (2006), and The Assistant (2015). In 2009, she was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.\n\nBaye was born in Mainneville, Eure, Normandy to Claude Baye and Denise Coustet, two painters. At 14, she joined a school of dance in Monaco. Three years later she went to the United States. On returning to France, she continued with dance but also registered for the Simon Course and was admitted to the Conservatoire, from where she graduated in 1972 with a second prize in comedy, dramatic comedy, and foreign theatre.\n\nHer second cinema appearance was in Two People (1973), directed by Robert Wise. She became better known as the script girl in Day for Night (La Nuit am\u00e9ricaine, 1973) by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Throughout the 1970s, she played the good girlfriend or nice provincial girl in film and television.\n\nShe won her first C\u00e9sar, as best supporting artist, for Every Man for Himself (Sauve qui peut (la vie), 1980) directed by Jean-Luc Godard. There then followed The Return of Martin Guerre (Le Retour de Martin Guerre, 1982) and La Balance (also 1982).\n\nBaye won two more C\u00e9sar Awards, Best Supporting Actress, for Strange Affair (Une \u00e9trange affaire, 1981), and Best Actress for La Balance, 1982). Her four-year relationship with Johnny Hallyday made them a celebrity couple and their daughter is Laura Smet, now an actress.\n\nAfter changing her image by playing a streetwalker in La Balance, she widened her scope with more obscure characters in J'ai \u00e9pous\u00e9 une ombre (1983) and En toute innocence (1988). In 1986, she returned to the theatre with an interpretation of Adriana Monti.\n\nIn 1999, she was voted Best Supporting Actress at Venice Film Festival for Une liaison pornographique and starred in V\u00e9nus Beaut\u00e9 (Institut) (2000) by Tonie Marshall which won multiple C\u00e9sar Awards including Best Film.\n\nShe has worked with Claude Chabrol and Steven Spielberg.\n\nSource: Article \"Nathalie Baye\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
