        "biography": "Maurice Colbourne\u00a0(24 September 1939 \u2013 4 August 1989) was a\u00a0British\u00a0stage\u00a0and\u00a0television actor who specialised in playing villains and hard men until 1985, when he took the key role of Tom Howard in the\u00a0BBC Television\u00a0serial,\u00a0Howards' Way. Colbourne was born Roger Middleton but took his stage name after reading about the death of actor Maurice Colbourne who shared the same birthday as he did. Colbourne's biggest success in the 1970s was as the lead in the crime drama series Gangsters. In the 80s he starred in Johnny Jarvis and the acclaimed adaptation of John Wyndham's classic sci-fi novel, The Day of the Triffids. Staying with sci-fi, he had a recurring guest role in Doctor Who as the mercenary Lytton, playing opposite the fifth and sixth doctors (Peter Davison and Colin Baker) in adventures featuring the timelords deadliest foes; the Daleks and the Cybermen.  But it was the leading role in Howards' Way that he will perhaps best be remembered for. He played Tom Howard until 1989, when he died suddenly aged 49 from a\u00a0heart attack. The show ended a year later.",
