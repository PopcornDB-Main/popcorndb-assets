        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand (November 13, 1909 \u2013 May 26, 1986) was a Swedish actor known for his frequent work with writer/director Ingmar Bergman. He was born in Stockholm. He appeared in over 120 films.\n\nBj\u00f6rnstrand at first had trouble finding work but got an engagement in Helsinki with his wife 1936-1938. Back in Stockholm he met Ingmar Bergman, at that time a mostly unknown theatre director. In the 1940s he got his first major film roles, making a breakthrough with the 1946 movie Kristin kommenderar. He was a versatile actor who could play tough and tender as well as comedy and tragedy. His daughter Veronica Bj\u00f6rnstrand is also an actress. One of his most famous roles was as the worldly squire who makes such a contrast to his austere and spiritual master in Bergman's most famous film The Seventh Seal.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia\u200b",
