He made his film debut as the lead in Universal Pictures Redeeming Love, a sweeping romance set in the Gold Rush era - a story of fate, resilience, and second chances.\n\nWhilst still a teenager at RADA, Tom landed a role in HBO's hit series Gentleman Jack opposite Suranne Jones. He's since starred in the PBS crime thriller Patience, AMC's supernatural drama A Discovery of Witches and the viral #1 music video Lewis Capaldi: Wish You the Best, which shattered streaming records.\n\nBeyond the screen, Tom brings the same intensity to the stage, leading acclaimed productions for companies like Headlong, Bristol Old Vic, and Hampstead Theatre.",
