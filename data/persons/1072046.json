Named the \"political conscience of 21st century American independent cinema,\" by Sight & Sound magazine, Wilkerson is heavily influenced by the Third Cinema movement, and known for films that combine \"maximalist aesthetics and radical politics.\" This is owed, in part, to his meeting Cuban filmmaker Santiago \u00c1lvarez. Following the meeting, Wilkerson made the feature documentary Accelerated Under-Development about that meeting, and he was heavily involved in the rediscovery of Alvarez's films.",
