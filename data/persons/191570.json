        "biography": "Phillip John Donahue (December 21, 1935 \u2013 August 18, 2024) was an American media personality, writer, film producer and the creator and host of The Phil Donahue Show. The television program, later known simply as Donahue, was the first talk show format that included audience participation. The show had a 29-year run on national television in America that began in Dayton, Ohio in 1967 and ended in New York City in 1996. His shows often focused on issues that divided liberals and conservatives in the United States, such as abortion, consumer protection, civil rights and war issues. His most frequent guest was Ralph Nader, for whom Donahue campaigned in 2000. Donahue also briefly hosted a talk show on MSNBC from July 2002 to March 2003. Donahue is one of the most influential talk show hosts and has been called the \"king of daytime talk\". Oprah Winfrey has stated, \"If it weren't for Phil Donahue, there would never have been an Oprah Show.\" In 1996, Donahue was ranked #42 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Phil Donahue, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
