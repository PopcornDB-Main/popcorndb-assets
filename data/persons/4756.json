Broderick began acting in off-Broadway productions in the early 1980s, soon after landing a role in Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs, for which he won a Tony Award. His first screen role was in Max Dugan Returns (1983), also penned by Neil Simon. His breakout role came the same year for his role as a young hacker in WarGames. Later Broderick starred in the hit film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1985), making him a household name. Subsequent notable films include Glory (1989), The Lion King (1994), The Cable Guy (1996), Godzilla (1998), and Election (1999).\n\nBroderick also continued acting on Broadway, including several musicals. He won a second Tony Award in 1995 for his performance in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and a third nomination in 2001 for The Producers.\n\nIn 1985 while on vacation in Ireland with his then-girlfriend Jennifer Grey, Broderick was involved in a head on collision that killed two locals. He was deemed at fault and faced up to five years in prison on the charge of causing death by dangerous driving, but was convicted of a lesser charge and fined \u00a3100. Broderick has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker since 1997, and the couple have three children.",
