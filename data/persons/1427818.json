Soon her tall athletic figure and beautifully shaped bald head were gracing catwalks all over Europe. Her look was copied by a number of young, black models, especially in the UK where many bald black women modeled for UK shows in the mid-90s.\n\nShe no longer does catwalk modelling, but has appeared in the movies\u00a0Le cinqui\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment\n\n\u00a0(1997), the latest Star War films and several music videos. Her clean-shaven head has been a permanent feature and become the most important part of her look.  - IMDb Mini Biography",
