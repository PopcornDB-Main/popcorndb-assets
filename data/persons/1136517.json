        "biography": "Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. Sia's music incorporates hip hop, funk and soul as a base for her vocal styling.\n\nShe started her career as a singer in the local Adelaide acid jazz band Crisp in the mid-1990s. In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut studio album titled OnlySee on Flavoured Records in Australia. Following the event, she moved to London, England and provided lead vocals for British duo Zero 7.\n\nIn 2000, Sia signed to Sony Music's sub-label Dance Pool and released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, the following year. Displeased with the promotion of the record, she signed to Go! Beat and released her third studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004. Dissatisfied with the project's struggling to connect with a mainstream audience, Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and began touring across the United States. Sia released her fourth and fifth studio releases, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, 1000 Forms of Fear, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S.\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0and generated the top-ten single \"Chandelier\" and a trilogy of music videos co-directed by Sia and starring child dancer\u00a0Maddie Ziegler. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.\n\nHer seventh studio album,\u00a0This Is Acting\u00a0(2016), spawned her first\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100\u00a0number one single, \"Cheap Thrills\". The same year, she began her\u00a0Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album,\u00a0Everyday Is Christmas, was released in 2017 and\u00a0reissued\u00a0in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018, she collaborated with\u00a0Labrinth\u00a0and\u00a0Diplo\u00a0in the group\u00a0LSD, and they released their\u00a0self-titled debut album\u00a0in April 2019. Sia has written many songs for films, and she directed a feature film, titled\u00a0Music, which was released in early 2021 alongside an album,\u00a0Music \u2013 Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture.\n\nAmong the\u00a0accolades\u00a0received by Sia are nearly a dozen\u00a0ARIA Awards, 9\u00a0Grammy Award\u00a0nominations and an\u00a0MTV Video Music Award.\n\nIn the 2014\u00a0South Park\u00a0episode \"The Cissy\", Sia provided the vocals for the fictional\u00a0Lorde\u00a0track \"Push (Feeling Good on a Wednesday)\".\u00a0In 2016, Sia covered \"Blackbird\" by\u00a0The Beatles\u00a0for the\u00a0Netflix\u00a0original series\u00a0Beat Bugs. She was the voice of pop star Songbird Serenade in the 2017 animated film\u00a0My Little Pony: The Movie and she contributed an original song, \"Rainbow\", to\u00a0the film's soundtrack. She wrote the songs for the\u00a0soundtrack\u00a0to the 2018 musical film\u00a0Vox Lux, with a score by\u00a0Scott Walker.\n\nShe wrote a screenplay (based on a story that she had written in 2007) for the 2021 musical film,\u00a0Music, which starred Ziegler,\u00a0Kate Hudson\u00a0and\u00a0Leslie Odom Jr. She also directed the film and wrote its soundtrack. It was nominated for\u00a0Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy\u00a0at the\u00a078th Golden Globe Awards. As director, Sia later won the\u00a0Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director.",
