Beyond Deep Space Nine, he appeared in several other Star Trek shows, wrote two Star Trek novels, and frequently appeared at science fiction conventions.\n\nHe grew up mostly around Washington, D.C., attended Bucknell University (earning a degree in political science), pursued a master's in set design at the University of Maryland, and even attended law school briefly. His early career included theater in Washington, New York, San Francisco, and Southern California, with roles spanning Shakespeare and other dramatic works, as well as some film appearances.\n\nHertzler lives in the Finger Lakes region of New York, where he has lectured at Cornell University\u2019s theater department and has been active in local politics and writing screenplays.\n\nHis filmography includes notable appearances outside of Star Trek, such as Quantum Leap, Zorro, Highlander, and others.",
