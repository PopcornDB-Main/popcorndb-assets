In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake won two Grammy Awards for his R&B-focused debut solo album Justified (2002) and its single \"Cry Me a River\". Another single from the album, \"Rock Your Body\", was also successful.\n\nHis critically acclaimed second album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and spawned the Hot 100 consecutive number-one singles with \"SexyBack\" (featuring Timbaland), \"My Love\" (featuring T.I.), and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, as he continued producing records and collaborating with other artists.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus. He held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits, and In Time.\n\nTimberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles, partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year and spawned the top three singles \"Suit & Tie\" (featuring Jay-Z) and \"Mirrors\". Timberlake voiced Branch in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls (2016), whose soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\", which earned him an Academy Award nomination. His fifth studio album Man of the Woods (2018) became his fourth number-one album in the US. Supported by the two top ten singles, \"Filthy\" and \"Say Something\" (featuring Chris Stapleton), it concluded 2018 as the sixth best-selling album of the year.",
