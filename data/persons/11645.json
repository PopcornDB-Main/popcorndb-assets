        "biography": "Born L\u00e9ontine Ernestine Gauch\u00e9, Bleuette Bernon was a French film actress who appeared in five films made by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s around the turn of the 20th century. The earliest films, made before 1900, were usually without plot and had a runtime of just a few minutes. However, M\u00e9li\u00e8s evolved the genre of the fictional motion picture, and Bernon became one of the earliest character actors in movies. In 1899, she played the title character in M\u00e9li\u00e8s's Jeanne d'Arc, and Cinderella in Cendrillon. In 1901, she appeared in Barbe-bleue. In 1902 she appeared in a minor role in A Trip to the Moon, which is the best known film of M\u00e9li\u00e8s, as one \"lady in the Moon\". In 1903 she appeared as Aurora in Le Royaume des f\u00e9es.",
