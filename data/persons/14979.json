        "biography": "Fortunio Bonanova, pseudonym of Josep Llu\u00eds Moll, (13 January 1895 \u2013 2 April 1969) was a Spanish baritone singer and a film, theater, and television actor. He occasionally worked as a producer and director.\n\nAccording to Lluis F\u00e0bregas Cuixart, the pseudonym Fortunio Bonanova referred to his desire to seek fortune, and his love of the Bonanova neighborhood in his native Palma.\n\nAs a young man, living under his birthname, he was a professional telegraph operator. He studied music with the Italian Giovachini. In 1921, he debuted as a singer in Tannh\u00e4user, at the Teatre Principal in Palma. That year, along with a group of Majorcan intellectuals and Jorge Luis Borges (who was briefly living in Majorca with his parents and sister), he signed the Ultraist Manifesto, using the name Fortunio Bonanova.\n\nAlso in 1921, he appeared in a silent film of Don Juan Tenorio by the brothers Ba\u00f1os, which was shown the following year in New York City and Hollywood. He later directed his own Don Juan in 1924.\n\nIn 1927, he acted in Love of Sunya, directed by Albert Parker and starring Gloria Swanson. In 1932 he had small parts in Hollywood productions featuring Joan Bennett and Mary Astor. In the same period, he appeared in New York in several operas as well as the zarzuelas La Canci\u00f3n del Olvido (\"The song of forgetting\"), La Duquesa del Tabar\u00edn (\"The Duchess of Tabar\u00edn\"), Los Gavilanes, and La Monter\u00eda. In 1934, he returned to Spain, where he had a major role in the film El Desaparecido (\"The disappeared one\") written and directed by Antonio Graciani. In 1935 he acted and sang in the film Poderoso Caballero (\"A Big Guy\"), directed by M\u00e0ximo Nossik.\n\nIn 1936, with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he returned to the United States, where he played the role of Captain Bill in a film called Capit\u00e1n Tormenta, directed by Jules Bernhardt. A sequence of increasingly larger acting and singing roles mostly in English-language films followed, especially after 1940. Among his roles were Signor Matiste, Susan Alexander Kane's opera coach in Citizen Kane (1941); General Sebastiano in Five Graves to Cairo (1943); Don Miguel in The Black Swan (1942); Fernando in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943); Sam Garlopis in Double Indemnity (1944); and a singing Christopher Columbus in Where Do We Go From Here?. He continued for the next several decades in a miscellany of character roles.",
