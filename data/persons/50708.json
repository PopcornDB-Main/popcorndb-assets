Kamel had a recurring role on Melrose Place in 1994 as Bruce Teller, the chief executive officer of D&D Advertising, where Amanda (Heather Locklear) and Allison (Courtney Thorne-Smith) were employed. During the first part of the sixth season of Beverly Hills, 90210, Kamel appeared on several episodes as Anthony Marchette, an organized crime figure. Kamel was most known for his role as Dr. Charles Kroger in the USA Network television series Monk, playing the infinitely patient and ever-supportive psychiatrist to the main character, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub).
