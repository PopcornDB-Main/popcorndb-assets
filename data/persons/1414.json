He is the son of animator Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the co-founders of Studio Ghibli. Described as \"reluctant\" to follow his father's career, Gor\u014d initially worked as a landscaper for many years before entering the film business.\n\nMiyazaki was born to animators Hayao Miyazaki and Akemi \u014cta in Tokyo. While growing up, Gor\u014d and his younger brother Keisuke found sketches of their parents' work. As a high school student, Gor\u014d thought that he \"would never be able to reach the level [his father] has attained.\" Gor\u014d instead decided to pursue an interest in landscape architecture. After graduating from Shinshu University's School of Agriculture, Gor\u014d later worked as a construction consultant in the planning and designing of parks and gardens. In 1998, Gor\u014d was involved in the design of the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, and served as its director from 2001 to June 2005.",
