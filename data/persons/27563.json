Her accolades include an Obie Award, two Golden Globe Award nominations, and one Academy Award nomination.\n\nBorn in Palo Alto, California, to actors Jules Irving and Priscilla Pointer, Irving spent her early life in San Francisco before her family relocated to New York City during her teenage years. In New York, she made her Broadway debut in The Country Wife (1965\u20131966) at age 13. Irving subsequently studied theater at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater and at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art before making her feature film debut in Brian De Palma's Carrie (1976), followed by a lead role in the 1978 supernatural thriller The Fury (1978).\n\nIn 1980, Irving appeared in a Broadway production of Amadeus before being cast in Yentl (1983), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
