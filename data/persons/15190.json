            "Julio Florencio Cort\u00e1zar"
        ],
        "biography": "Julio Florencio Cort\u00e1zar (26 August 1914 \u2013 12 February 1984) was an Argentine, nationalized French novelist, short story writer, essayist, and translator. Known as one of the founders of the Latin American Boom, Cort\u00e1zar influenced an entire generation of Spanish-speaking readers and writers in America and Europe.\n\nHe is considered one of the most innovative and original authors of his time, a master of history, poetic prose and short story in general and a creator of important novels that inaugurated a new way of making literature in the Hispanic world by breaking the classical moulds through narratives that escaped temporal linearity.\n\nHe lived his childhood and adolescence and incipient maturity in Argentina and, after the 1950s, in Europe. He lived in Italy, Spain, and in Switzerland. In 1951, he settled in France for more than three decades and composed some of his works there.\n\nJulio Cort\u00e1zar was born on 26 August 1914, in Ixelles, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. According to biographer Miguel Herr\u00e1ez, his parents, Julio Jos\u00e9 Cort\u00e1zar and Mar\u00eda Herminia Descotte, were Argentine citizens, and his father was attached to the Argentine diplomatic service in Belgium.\n\nAt the time of Cort\u00e1zar's birth, Belgium was occupied by the German troops of Kaiser Wilhelm II. After German troops arrived in Belgium, Cort\u00e1zar and his family moved to Z\u00fcrich where Mar\u00eda Herminia's parents, Victoria Gabel and Louis Descotte (a French National), were waiting in neutral territory. The family group spent the next two years in Switzerland, first in Z\u00fcrich, then Geneva, before moving for a short period to Barcelona. The Cort\u00e1zars settled outside of Buenos Aires by the end of 1919.\n\nCort\u00e1zar's father left when Julio was six, and the family had no further contact with him. Cort\u00e1zar spent most of his childhood in Banfield, a suburb south of Buenos Aires, with his mother and younger sister. The home in Banfield, with its back yard, was a source of inspiration for some of his stories. Despite this, in a letter to Graciela M. de Sol\u00e1 on 4 December 1963, he described this period of his life as \"full of servitude, excessive touchiness, terrible and frequent sadness.\" He was a sickly child and spent much of his childhood in bed reading. His mother, who spoke several languages and was a great reader herself, introduced her son to the works of Jules Verne, whom Cort\u00e1zar admired for the rest of his life. In the magazine Plural (issue 44, Mexico City, May 1975) he wrote: \"I spent my childhood in a haze full of goblins and elves, with a sense of space and time that was different from everybody else's\". ...\n\nSource: Article \"Julio Cort\u00e1zar\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
