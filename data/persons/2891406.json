But eventually I realized the scope and possibility of ballet, and figured out that was where my heart was.\u201d\n\nToday Vance\u2019s jazz background shines through in her performances of contemporary work like Val Caniparoli\u2019s Lambarena and the ballets of PAB choreographer-in-residence Matthew Neenan. \u201cMany of the newer ballets involve isolations of the hips and the rib cage\u2014something that ballet dancers have trouble with,\u201d Vance says. \u201cEven out in clubs ballerinas tend to look funny! But thanks to my jazz training, I\u2019ve been working on those types of movements for years.\u201d",
