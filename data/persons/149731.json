Mark Ginther has been in the business of both acting and stunt performing since the 1980s. Notably, Mark appeared in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turles II: Secret of the Ooze (1991) as the mutant wolf Rahzar. He also appeared in the body suit role of Lord Zedd in the 90s outing Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995). Mark stunt doubled for actor Abram Benrubi in George of the Jungle (1997) and performed further stunts in the Will Smith, Kevin Kline action comedy Wild Wild West (1999). Going into the new millennium, Mark's resume in stunt work continued to flourish with credits in Jurassic Park III (2001), Spider-Man (2002), Daredevil and even the fourth Bruce Willis installment in the Die Hard series, Live Free or Die Hard (2007). With his vast knowledge of stunt work, Mark has undoubtedly secured a steady line of job assignments within Hollywood, whether he is acting, executing a stunt or helping rig a stunt instead.  - IMDb Mini Biography",
