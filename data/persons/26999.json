With the help of his friends, and the local nerd, Homer sets to do just that by trial and a lot of error. Unfortunately, most of the town, and especially Homer's father, thinks that they are wasting their time.

Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars.",
