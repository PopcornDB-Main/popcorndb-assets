His grown children are concerned about their father\u2019s well-being and buy him a caretaker robot. Initially resistant to the idea, Frank soon appreciates the benefits of robotic support \u2013 like nutritious meals and a clean house \u2013 and eventually begins to treat his robot like a true companion. With his robot\u2019s assistance, Frank\u2019s passion for his old, unlawful profession is reignited, for better or worse.",
