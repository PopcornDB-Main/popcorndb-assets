She was nominated for a 1996 Saturn Award in the category of Best Performance By a Younger Actor.\n\nJudith Vittet was picked out of hundreds of young actresses auditioning for the part of Miette (\"Crumb\").\n\nThe director Jean-Pierre Jeunet explains: \"We did tests with her, and she had shown a toughness out of the ordinary, and perfect professionalism: she had the right tone, she understands everything, she was totally amazing.\"\n\nVittet enjoyed her time as an actress in this movie but was not certain as to whether she would continue acting, mentioning that she doesn't want to be an actress, but an architect or an archaeologist.\n\nVittet herself was quite touched by her own performance in the film, but credits that to the director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's guidance.\n\nPrior to her role as Miette, Vittet was cast as Lili in Personne ne m'aime (1994). She also had roles in Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud (1995) and K (1997).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Judith Vittet\u00a0\u00a0 licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
