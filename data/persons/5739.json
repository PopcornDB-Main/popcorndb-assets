Shayne was married two times and he also had children.\n\nAs an actor, Konstantin Shayne performed in movies such as None but the Lonely Heart (1944) and The Stranger (1946), starring (and directed by) Orson Welles. He performed in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947) which featured Danny Kaye in the lead role. His performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943) was cut from the final release. In his last film appearance Shayne dominates two minutes of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo, playing the old bookseller Pop Leibel.",
