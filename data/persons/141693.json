        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nGeorge Smith Lindsey (December 17, 1928 \u2013 May 6, 2012) was an American character actor, best known for his role as Goober Pyle on The Andy Griffith Show, Mayberry R.F.D. and his subsequent tenure on Hee-Haw.\n\nIn 1964, Lindsey was cast as the slow-witted but kindly \"Goober Beasley\" on The Andy Griffith Show. His character was later renamed \"Goober Pyle\" to tie him to his cousin Gomer Pyle, slow-witted country boy played by Jim Nabors, also from Alabama. Goober's antics frequently included his exaggerated \"Goober Dance\" and his comically bad Cary Grant impression.\n\nAs Lindsey started his portrayal as Goober, he also had a minor role in the Walter Brennan series The Tycoon on ABC. Lindsey played a sailor in the 1964 film Ensign Pulver, the sequel to Mister Roberts. He also had a role in a Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode entitled Submarine Sunk Here. He appeared in six episodes of the television series Gunsmoke. He played a blackmailing taxicab driver in the \"Bed of Roses\" episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.",
