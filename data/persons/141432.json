As a child Allen started to entertain at the early age of 5. \"He would hit the floor and break dance at the slightest sound of music\" Says his mother. At the age of seven things started to change for Allen due to a dangerous environment and some of his neighbors in Compton. He, his mother and two older sisters moved into a home in Rialto, California. His first foray into the entertainment business was dancing on Soul Train. This first love would lead him to his true love... Acting! Allen's senior year in high school is when the acting bug bit him. He performed in numerous comedy shows and pep rallies. After graduating he took some acting classes in the Inland Empire which put him in front of a manager by the name of Vance from Advance LA. This would help him make the transition to Los Angeles. His first appearance as a working actor would come soon afterwards. Starring in a PBS educational program called \"Madison Heights\" Allen portrayed the role of \"Tyrone\" a young street thug. Noticing the charisma and potential in Allen, Vance would later refer him to a woman that would change his life forever...Mrs. Bobbie Shaw Chance. Her alumni is some of the most wanted actors in the business such as Drew Barrymore, Giovanni Ribisi, Kiko Ellworth, and many other of Hollywood's elite.

Allen quickly grew to love and understand the craft of acting. Shortly after joining Bobbie's acting studio, Allen booked his first big screen appearance in the hit film \"Friday After Next\" as a juvenile delinquent that would attack Ice Cube and Mike Epps with a pool stick.
