        "biography": "Matt LaBorde is a British-born stunt performer and actor. Growing up near RAF Northolt in London, he began his journey in action sports as a youth, spending hours clay pigeon shooting and eventually becoming the head trapper at a gun club. Seeking an escape from the rough council estate environment, he later joined the military, where he excelled in national military skills and running competitions. That same discipline paved the way for his certification as a personal trainer\u2014a role in which he honed his ability to connect across diverse backgrounds while conditioning actors and public clients alike.\n\nLaBorde's entry into the stunt profession was marked by his rigorous qualification through the British Stunt Register, demonstrating mastery across six main disciplines: formation skydiving, gymnastics, fencing, trampolining, kickboxing, and swimming, as well as horse riding training. His varied skill set includes precision driving, martial arts, aerial work, firearms and weapon handling, rigging, water safety, and comedic acting\u2014all underscored by formal training in disciplines ranging from kickboxing to industrial rope access.\n\nDespite suffering a serious skydiving accident early in his career\u2014which sidelined him for months and compelled him to rebuild financially and educationally\u2014LaBorde pursued higher education vigorously. Having left school at the age of 14 without qualifications, he later earned a Public Relations HND, a degree in product design, and an MA in advertising. He is currently completing an MA in Comedy Writing for Film and TV at Falmouth University (2023\u20132025).\n\nLaBorde has built an impressive portfolio in film and television. His film credits encompass high-profile blockbusters such as\u00a0Avengers: Infinity War,\u00a0Avengers: Endgame,\u00a0Black Adam,\u00a0Extraction II,\u00a0The Walking Dead,\u00a0The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and\u00a0She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. Notably, he received award recognition for his contribution to\u00a0Avengers: Endgame. He continued his relationship with Marvel Studios, doubling Tom Hiddleston's Loki for six episodes of\u00a0Loki\u00a0Season 1 (2021).  LaBorde's multifaceted abilities and adaptability have earned him roles beyond stunts. He has performed as a fight coordinator, stunt coordinator, visual effects artist, and actor in productions like\u00a0Keepsake,\u00a0By Night's End, and\u00a0Extraction II. Proficient across disciplines, he remains legally and HSE qualified.",
