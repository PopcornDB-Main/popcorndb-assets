He also made some appearances in Season Three of Grange Hill as a slightly comical workman sporting a comb over, often seen in confrontation with staff and pupils. However, his character showed a kinder side when he cleaned Duane Orpington's new coat in episode two. He also played the mad Head Teacher in The Boot Street Band, a TV series written by Steve Attridge and Andrew Davies.\n\nHe appeared as a vicar in John Cleese's film A Fish Called Wanda as well as in Le P\u00e9tomane and The Last Remake of Beau Geste.",
