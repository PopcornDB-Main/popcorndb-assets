He is also well known for his appearance in several Val Lewton films.\n\nConway was born in St. Petersburg, Russia. At the outbreak of the Russian Revolution (1917), the family moved to England, where he was educated. In England, he appeared in several plays with the Manchester Repertory Company and performed on BBC Radio.",
