        "biography": "Aur\u00e9lien Recoing (born 5 May 1958) is a French actor and stage director.\n\nAur\u00e9lien Recoing is the son of Alain Recoing (puppeteer), and the brother of \u00c9loi Recoing (director and translator), Blaise Recoing (actor and musician), and David Recoing (pianist, composer).\n\nBorn in Paris on May 5, 1958, Aur\u00e9lien Recoing began training to be an actor in 1974 at Cours Florent, and studied at Quartier d'Ivry. In 1977, the actor-in-training, who spoke fluent English and a little Russian, joined the Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur d'art dramatique in Paris, where he studied under Jean-Pierre Miquel and Antoine Vitez. He has appeared in more than 30 plays and has directed stage performances of works by Thomas Bernhard, Fernando Pessoa and Paul Claudel. He was awarded the Prix G\u00e9rard Philipe in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Aur\u00e9lien Recoing took his first steps into the world of cinema, in Exploits of a Young Don Juan. Finding art-house cinema appealing to him, he worked with Philippe Garrel on Emergency Kisses (Les baisers de secours), and with Laurence Ferreira Barbosa on Modern Life. The actor rose to fame in 2001 thanks to Laurent Cantet's Time Out (L'Emploi du Temps), in which he plays a man who invents a false life to avoid having to tell his friends and family that he has been fired from his job. As he became more and more in demand, he alternated between blockbusters such as Ruby & Quentin and That Woman and art-house films like L'Ennemi naturel and Orlando Vargas. Lending his talents to a number of unusual projects, in 2006 he portrayed a gamblers in 13 Tzameti, G\u00e9la Babluani's black-and-white thriller, and also appeared in Forgive Me (Pardonnez-moi), Ma\u00efwenn's home-movie style drama. In the same year, the physically imposing actor found himself transported back to 1914 France in Fragments of Antonin, and then to 1959 Kabylia in Florent Emilio Siri's Intimate Enemies. In 2008, he starred in Franck Llopis' Paris Nord-Sud and in La Saison des Orphelins. The following year, he was cast in Gilles B\u00e9hat's crime thriller Diamant 13 with G\u00e9rard Depardieu, and in Denis Dercourt's Tomorrow at Dawn (Demain d\u00e8s l'aube).\n\nHe has made appearances in The Horde, directed by Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher, Xavier de Choudens' Joseph and the Girl with Jacques Dutronc, and L\u00e9on Desclozeaux's Cargo, the Lost Men in 2010. He appeared in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schoendoerffer's Switch, as well as in Olias Barco's Kill Me Please, which won the Marc'Aurelio d'Oro for best film at Rome Film Festival in 2010. He also appeared in Abdellatif Kechiche's Blue is the Warmest Colour, which took the Palme d'Or at Cannes. In 2020 he appeared in Adults in the room. An upcoming appearance is in Grand Ciel an Arte Film.\n\nHe made his first short film as a director The Rifleman (Un Bon Tireur) which won an Award Winner for Best Drama in 2021. He is developing his first feature film Naked Hands (\u00c0 Mains Nues) with Sensito Films Productions.\n\nSource: Article \"Aur\u00e9lien Recoing\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
