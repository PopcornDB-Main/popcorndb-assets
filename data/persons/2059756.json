        "biography": "Born Esserlaine Jones in Baton Rouge, La., JJ Bad Boy Jones began playing the guitar at age 5 and singing in a Baptist church choir soon after.\n\nAt 16 he took a job as a long-haul truck driver and started to compose lyrics as he drove.\n\nHe quit his day job after undergoing back surgery in 1996, Lyle said. He was almost 70 at the time.\n\nSmall in stature with a powerful voice, Jones arrived in Los Angeles in the late 1950s and began\n\nperforming in local clubs and bars.\n\nHe was faithful to the blues music he grew up with in the South, playing songs made popular by a number\n\nof his friends, particularly Albert King; King\u2019s brother, B.B. King; Stevie Ray Vaughn; and Jones\u2019 cousin,\n\nEddie \u201cGuitar Slim\u201d Jones.\n\nJones\u2019 friends called him the \u201cbad boy\u201d of blues guitarists as a sign of respect, and he was dubbed J.J. by\n\nAlbert King as a compliment suggesting his own legendary brother.\n\nWith his band, \u201cThe Bad Boys,\u201d Jones regularly performed at Harvelle\u2019s Blues Club in Santa Monica,\n\nB.B. King\u2019s Club at Universal City and Babe\u2019s and Ricky\u2019s Inn in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cJ.J. was a fixture in the Los Angeles blues scene,\u201d said Jan Garfinkle, who played keyboard with Jones\u2019\n\nband for many years. \u201cHe played traditional blues and he was an excellent guitarist, even in his 70s.\u201d\n\nJones recorded three albums. The best-known, \u201cAshes in the Wind\u201d (Aries Records), was released in\n\n1998.",
