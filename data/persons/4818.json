He is soon invited to her sumptuous Palermo villa, little suspecting that this is part of a plot. He bears an amazing likeness to Maria's stool-pigeon gangster husband and it would be convenient for them if the mobster, in the shape of Dante, was seen to be dead and buried.",

The elder Benigni used humour in retelling his experiences, which helped shape his son\u2019s comedic skill. Benigni briefly attended a Jesuit seminary in Florence, and, after a stint as a magician\u2019s assistant, he joined an underground theatre group in the late 1960s.",
