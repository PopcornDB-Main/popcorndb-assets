        "biography": "Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach in Bristol, England) was a British-American actor, celebrated for his debonair charm, impeccable comic timing, and sophisticated screen presence. He became one of Hollywood\u2019s most iconic leading men, starring in classics such as Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940), Notorious (1946), and North by Northwest (1959).\n\nGrant had a difficult childhood, marked by his mother\u2019s institutionalization and his father\u2019s alcoholism. At 16, he joined the Pender Troupe, a group of acrobats, which led him to New York City, where he built a career in vaudeville before transitioning to Hollywood in the early 1930s.\n\nHis breakthrough came with screwball comedies, where his witty delivery and effortless charisma made him a favorite among audiences. He worked with legendary directors such as Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, and George Cukor, solidifying his reputation as a versatile and enduring star.\n\nGrant was married five times, but his longtime companionship with fellow actor Randolph Scott fueled speculation about his sexuality. The two lived together for over a decade, sharing a home in Los Angeles, which led to rumors that they were romantically involved. While Grant never publicly addressed these claims, some biographers suggest that his relationship with Scott was more than just friendship.\n\nDespite the speculation, Grant maintained a carefully curated public image, often portraying the ideal romantic lead opposite Hollywood\u2019s most glamorous actresses, including Katharine Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, and Grace Kelly.\n\nGrant retired from acting in 1966, choosing to focus on business ventures and his family. He received an Academy Honorary Award in 1970 and was honored with the Kennedy Center Award in 1981. He passed away on November 29, 1986, at the age of 82.\n\nHis legacy remains unmatched, with the American Film Institute ranking him as the second greatest male star of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age. His timeless appeal, effortless sophistication, and enigmatic personal life continue to fascinate audiences and film historians alike.",
