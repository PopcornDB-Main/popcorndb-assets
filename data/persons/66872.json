After investing two years, and millions of dollars, the gigantic project ended in failure; but the artists Jodorowsky brought together to carry it out continued to work together, and ended up laying the foundations for modern science fiction cinema.",

She first came to the public attention as the model on the cover of Roxy Music's album For Your Pleasure in 1973. She was a multimillion selling Disco Queen in the mid-1970s to the early 1980s mainly in Continental Europe and Scandinavia with hits such as \"Queen of Chinatown\", \"Follow Me\", \"Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)\" and \"Fashion Pack\".
