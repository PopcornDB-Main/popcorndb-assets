The school's hard-nosed principal is rightly suspicious of Finn's activities. But Finn's roommate remains in the dark about what he's doing.",

        "biography": "Kevin Alexander Clark was born on December 3, 1988 in Highland Park, Illinois. He played the drums since he was three years old but didn't take private lessons until the fifth grade. He was so skilled in his performances that each one demanded a standing ovation from the audience. Kevin was an active member of the Highland Park High School's concert band and also part of its jazz bands. Not only did he have his drumming career mixed together with his acting career, he formed his own garage band where he played the drums - and a little guitar and bass when needed. Kevin composed several original pieces on computer and on guitar. He was introduced to acting at the age of thirteen, playing one of the rocking kids, Freddy Jones, in Paramount Pictures' School of Rock (2003) with Jack Black and Joan Cusack. The film had a number-one opening weekend, October 3rd, 2003, in the USA, and ended up grossing $81m domestically. While Kevin never appeared in another film again, he continued drumming in Chicago-era bands, most recently Jess Bess and the Intentions.\n\nKevin died on May 26, 2021 in Chicago, after being hit by a motorist. He was 32 years old.",
