        "biography": "Luca Barbareschi (born 28 July 1956 in Montevideo) is an Italian-Uruguayan actor, television presenter, and former member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Barbareschi is Jewish.\n\nHe was one of four actors whom the Italian police believed had been murdered in the making of the 1980 horror film Cannibal Holocaust, where he also abused and killed a young piglet. So realistic was the film that shortly after it was released its director Ruggero Deodato was arrested on suspicions of murder. The actors had signed contracts to stay out of the media for a year in order to fuel rumours that the film was a snuff movie. The court was only convinced that they were alive when the contracts were cancelled and the actors appeared on a television show as proof.\n\nIn 2008, he was elected as Member of the Italian Parliament at the Chamber of Deputies with Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right party The People of Freedom. In 2010 he joined, with other 32 deputies and 10 senators, the Gianfranco Fini's new party Future and Freedom. He left parliament in 2013.\n\nOn 11 June 2012 he becomes the protagonist of an attack against Filippo Roma, a journalist. He attacked the cameraman Marco Occhipinti destroying the camera and stealing his personal smartphone, with which he was filming the attack. The police rushed to the scene but without making any arrest, unable to search him for parliamentary immunity. The journalist filed a complaint for theft, but according to some witnesses the cell phone, never returned, would have been destroyed by Barbareschi.\n\nOn 28 August 2012 in Filicudi a similar event is repeated which sees Barbareschi attack again with kicks and punches the journalist Filippo Roma and hit his cameraman.\n\nSource: Article \"Luca Barbareschi\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
