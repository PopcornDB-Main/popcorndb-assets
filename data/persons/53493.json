In early 2009, Penn was offered the position of Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, which he accepted, necessitating his character Lawrence Kutner being written out of the TV series House. In 2020, Penn wrote a memoir called \"You Can't Be Serious\". While promoting this memoir, Penn announced that he and his boyfriend of 11 years, named Josh, were engaged",
