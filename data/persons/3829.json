        "biography": "Jean-Paul Belmondo\u00a0(born 9 April 1933 \u2013 6 September 2021) was a\u00a0French actor\u00a0initially associated with the\u00a0New Wave\u00a0of the 1960s.\n\nBorn in\u00a0Neuilly-sur-Seine,\u00a0Hauts-de-Seine, west of Paris, Belmondo did not perform well in school, but developed a passion for boxing and football. Belmondo made his amateur boxing debut on 10 May 1949 in Paris, France, when he knocked out Rene DesMarais in one round. Belmondo's boxing career was undefeated, but brief. He won three straight first round knockout victories from 1949 to 1950.\n\nHis breakthrough role was in\u00a0Jean-Luc Godard's\u00a0Breathless\u00a0(1960), which made him a major figure in the\u00a0French New Wave. Later he acted in\u00a0Jean-Pierre Melville's philosophical movie\u00a0Leon Morin, Priest\u00a0(1961) and in Melville's\u00a0film noir\u00a0crime film\u00a0The Fingerman\u00a0(Le Doulos, 1963) and Godard again with\u00a0Pierrot le fou\u00a0(1965). With\u00a0That Man From Rio\u00a0(1965) he switched to commercial, mainstream productions, mainly comedies and action films but did appear in the title role of\u00a0Alain Resnais' masterpiece\u00a0Stavisky\u00a0(1974), which some critics regard as Belmondo's finest performance.\n\nUntil the mid-1980s, when he ceased to be one of France's biggest box-office stars, Belmondo's typical characters were either dashing adventurers or more cynical heroes. As he grew older, Belmondo preferred concentrating on his stage work, where he encountered success. He suffered a stroke in 2001 and had since been absent from the stage and the screen until 2009 when he appeared in\u00a0Un homme et son chien\u00a0(A man and his dog) which was his last performance.\n\nBelmondo died on 6 September 2021 at his home in Paris, after a period of ill health, at the age of 88.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Paul Belmondo, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
