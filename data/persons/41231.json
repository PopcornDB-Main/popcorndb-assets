He trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, played the lead role in Stalag 17 by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski on Broadway (1951). He went on to make a number of films for MGM in quick succession in the 1950s.

He then went on to appear in a series of films which included Rhapsody, The Student Prince, Green Fire (all in 1954), and Bad Day at Black Rock (1955).\n\nHis career continued, mostly on television, for the next thirty years. He appeared in the lead role in \"The Peter Bartley Story\" of CBS's fantasy drama, The Millionaire. Child actor Johnny Washbrook appeared in the same episode in a flashback segment of Ericson as a boy.
