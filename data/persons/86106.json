He starred in films such as Alfie, Adolf Hitler - My Part In His Downfall, Villain and even Superman, but it is the small screen that was his more natural home; he headlined Get Some In (1975) as the memorable bully Corporal Marsh, and had a main part in Love Hurts (1992-94) opposite Adam Faith and Zoe Wanamaker. Perhaps his greatest contribution had been guest appearances where his charisma, which could be menacing when he chose, saw him pop up in several high profile and popular series - from his recurring role as the roguish Glitz in Dr Who, to Casualty, Lovejoy, Holby City, The Bill and EastEnders to name but a few.",
