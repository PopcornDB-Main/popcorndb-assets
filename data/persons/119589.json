While he studied at New York University and after working in Derrick Comedy, a comedy group, Glover was hired by Tina Fey to write for the NBC sitcom 30 Rock at age 23. He gained fame for portraying college student Troy Barnes on the NBC sitcom Community from 2009 to 2014. From 2016 to 2022, he starred in the FX series Atlanta, which he created and occasionally directed. For his work on Atlanta, he won various accolades, including two Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as two Golden Globe Awards.\n\nGlover has appeared in several films, including the supernatural horror The Lazarus Effect (2015), the comedy-drama Magic Mike XXL (2015), and the science fiction film The Martian (2015). He played Aaron Davis in the superhero film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), as well as Lando Calrissian in the space western Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). He provided the voice of adult Simba in The Lion King (2019) and produced the short film Guava Island (2019), in which he starred. He co-created the comedy thriller television series Swarm (2023). Glover is also credited as a principal inspiration for the creation of the Marvel Comics superhero Miles Morales/Spider-Man, whom Glover himself briefly voiced in the animated series Ultimate Spider-Man. In 2024, he created and starred in the Prime Video series Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\n\nAfter a number of independently released projects, Glover signed with Glassnote Records in 2011 and released his debut studio album, Camp, in November of that year to critical and commercial success. His second album, Because the Internet (2013), was supported by the single \"3005,\" which became his first Billboard Hot 100 entry. His psychedelic funk-inspired 2016 single, \"Redbone,\" peaked at number 12 on the chart, won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance, and preceded the release of his third album, \"Awaken, My Love!\" (2016), which saw continued success. Glover's 2018 single, \"This Is America,\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100 and won in all of the categories for which it was nominated at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rap/Sung Performance, and Best Music Video; it won a Guinness World Record as the first hip hop song to win in the former two categories. His fourth album, 3.15.20, was released in 2020.[17]In 2024, he released Atavista, a reworking of 3.15.20, and later his fifth album, Bando Stone & the New World.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Donald Glover, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
