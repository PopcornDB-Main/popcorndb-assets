She spent most of her childhood as an aerial contortionist and mime in a pre-professional circus troupe ( bet you haven't heard that one before! ), while also dabbling in dance, ice skating and acting. It wasn't until high school, while talking classes at American Conservatory Theater (ACT), that she really got bit the acting bug and knew she had to pursue a professional career.\n\nGillian is a graduate of the University of Southern California where she transferred after attending the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, studying with The Atlantic Acting School and learning she really is a California girl at heart.\n\nBesides acting, Gillian loves anything adventurous, traveling, photography, a good pun, and puppies...lots of puppies.",
