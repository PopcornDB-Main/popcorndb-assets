        "biography": "Eddie O'Connell (b 1960) is an English actor best known for playing the lead in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners.\n\nO'Connell had studied acting but was very inexperienced when cast in the lead, atlhough he had done some stage work. He worked as a gas fitter before becoming an actor. His Absolute Beginners co star Patsy Kensit later wrote \"there was no chemistry between Eddie and me... which didn\u2019t help matters, though there was nothing either of us could do about it. I\u2019m sure Stephen Woolley and Julien thought I hated Eddie, but I didn\u2019t. We simply didn\u2019t gel on screen or off, which must have been a huge disappointment. O'Connell worked steadily in television after Absolute Beginners. His other movie credits include Sexy Beast and his television credits include Civvies. He later acted under the name \"Edward O'Connell\"",
