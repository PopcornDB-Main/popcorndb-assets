Her love for movies began at a very young age, which served as the igniting fire for her passion. She was often ridiculed and bullied by her peers growing up for her wildly active imagination and bold creativity, though she did not let that stop her. A theatre actress from the age of 11, a self-taught guitar player and singer/songwriter from the age of 13, and a charismatic soul in search of every avenue in which she can express herself artistically, Sarah is an adept performer who knows no bounds and is always seeking a challenge.",
