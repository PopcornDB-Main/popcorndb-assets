        "biography": "Ron Jeremy is the stage name of an American pornographic actor. Nicknamed \"The Hedgehog\", he was ranked by AVN at number one in their \"The 50 Top Porn Stars of All Time\" list. Jeremy has also appeared in non-pornographic films, such as The Boondock Saints, The Chase, Orgazmo, and 54. He is noted for his 9.75-inch (~24.75 cm) penis (self-reported) \u2014and he has gained some notoriety for being capable of autofellatio (which he first demonstrated on-screen in Inside Seka).\n\nJeremy was accused of sexual assault more than a dozen times between 2017 and 2022, for incidents stretching back to 2004. He was charged with 30 counts of either rape or sexual assault over a span of 16 years from 2004 to 2020 that involved 21 victims, including a 15-year-old girl. He was initially jailed awaiting trial, but Jeremy's trial was suspended pending a mental health examination, after Jeremy was reported to be \"incoherent\" and unable to recognize his own lawyer, and was subsequently transferred to a mental health facility in November 2023. A judge found him mentally unfit to stand trial due to \"incurable neurocognitive decline\"",
