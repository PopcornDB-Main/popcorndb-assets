Her status as an iconic fashion character was further cemented with her role in Robert Altman\u2019s 1994 satirical fashion film Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter. Today, she is a theater actress, charity spokesperson for the Ghanian Charity OrphanAid Africa, and the face of luxury ad campaigns.\n\nBorn in Palma de Mallorca, she was originally a singer and dancer for the band Peor Imposible before being discovered by filmmaker Pedro Almod\u00f3var at a caf\u00e9 in Madrid in 1986. He cast her in roles based on her unique, Picassoesque appearance. She is best known for her roles in Almod\u00f3var films like La ley del deseo (Law of Desire), Kika, Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios (Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown) and La flor de mi secreto (The Flower of My Secret).\n\nShe acts in France and does modeling. She appeared in Robert Altman's Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter as Pilar. In 2007, she released a perfume line under her name through the French cosmetics company Etat libre d'Orange. In 2009, she posed nude in an information campaign on breast cancer for the magazine Marie Claire. She currently lives in France with her two sons.\n\nShe was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.",
