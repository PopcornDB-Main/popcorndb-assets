        "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nArthur Housman (October 10, 1889 \u2013 April 8, 1942) was an American actor in films during both the silent film era and the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\nInitially as a leading man, Housman later became known as Hollywood's most familiar comic drunkard in films of the 1930s, usually playing cameo parts in features but with better opportunities in short films. His best remembered roles were in several Laurel and Hardy films, notably Scram!, Our Relations and (in the title role) The Live Ghost. He also played a frustrated timekeeper in the Three Stooges' film Punch Drunks.\n\nHousman died of pneumonia at age 52. He was married to Ellen Grubley (31 July 1893 - 21 May 1960) from 1919 until his death in 1942.",
