Matt then made his way to Hollywood where he graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and went on to be a member of their theater company ('06).. He supported his early years bouncing and working as an autism behavioral therapist. Matt rowed a boat from Monterey, CA to Oahu, HI over the summer of 2014 in 57 days 5 hours 45 minutes. Matt shares the world record with his 3 crew mates for the first ever mixed sex team of 4 to row across the Pacific ocean unsupported.",
