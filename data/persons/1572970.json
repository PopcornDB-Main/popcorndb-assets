With the help of his friends, and the local nerd, Homer sets to do just that by trial and a lot of error.

Only one teacher understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize. Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars.",
