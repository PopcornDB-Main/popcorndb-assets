        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMaria-Pia Casilio (5 May 1935 \u2013 10 April 2012) was an Italian film actress, best known for her roles in Umberto D. and Un americano a Roma.\n\nBorn in San Pio delle Camere, L'Aquila, Casilio was pretty active between 1952 and 1960, usually with the typical characterization of a querulous and naive small-town girl, then, after her marriage with the voice actor Giuseppe Rinaldi, she semi-retired from acting. On the Criterion Collection DVD release of Umberto D. Vittorio De Sica comments she was a lucky charm to have her in his films.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Maria Pia Casilio \u00a0 licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia. \u00a0",
