        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nIrving Bacon (September 6, 1893 \u2013 February 5, 1965) was an American character actor who appeared in almost 500 films.\n\nBacon played on the stage for a number of years before getting into films in 1920. He was sometimes cast in films directed by Lloyd Bacon (incorrectly named as his brother in some sources) such as The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938). He often played comical \"average guys\".\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, he played the weary postman Mr. Crumb in Columbia Pictures' Blondie film series. One of his bigger roles was as a similarly flustered postman in the thriller Cause for Alarm! in 1952.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Bacon worked steadily in a number of television sitcoms, most notably I Love Lucy, where he appeared in two episodes, one which cast him as Ethel Mertz's father.",
