Although her focus began in theatre, she found her true passion in film and TV. Along with acting, she also enjoys writing both screenplays and music, producing and directing.\n\nAnna's second passion is animal rescue. She's an active volunteer and foster for several local organizations, and has 3 rescues of her own.\n\nAs a student, she is a member of Phi Theta Kappa, a National Honor Society for student leaders with a GPA in the top 5%, as her dedication to education is as focused as her professional career.",
