His father Robert was a US Army Veteran and served with the famed Tuskegee Airmen in WWII and his uncle is former NY Giant hall of famer Roosevelt Brown.  Leiba attended high school in NJ and later moved to Tempe, Arizona where he attended\u00a0 High School.

He signed with Arizona State under the condition that he be allowed to play both football and basketball for the school. After graduating he went to Spain to play professional basketball for Barcelona EL of the European League where he played a full season. After being waived in his second season Leiba took an invitation to the NFL San Diego Chargers mini-camp where he impressed coaches with his tremendous speed and leaping ability. He made the \"Practice Squad\" but was soon released when he told head coach Bobby Ross that he wanted to be an actor and could no longer commit to sports.  Leiba gained national attention when he won the the TLC'S reality action show Help Wanted, a spin-off of ABC TV'S The Next Action Hero, where competitors compete in acting and stunt roles. Leiba again showed his great athleticism and the guile that he is known for but coupled that with great acting ability.  Raw Leiba has gone on to do major movies and motion pictures and is also one of the top Sportsmodels in the world",
