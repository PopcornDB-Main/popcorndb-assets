        "biography": "Dierkes was born on February 10, 1905 in\u00a0Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended\u00a0Brown University\u00a0and subsequently went to work as an\u00a0economist\u00a0for the\u00a0United States Department of State. In 1941 he joined the\u00a0Red Cross\u00a0and served in the\u00a0Britain\u00a0duringWorld War II. There he met director\u00a0John Huston\u00a0who recommended that he try\u00a0Hollywood\u00a0after the war. Instead, Dierkes went to work for the\u00a0U.S. Treasury Department\u00a0which coincidentally sent him to Hollywood to function as\u00a0technical advisor\u00a0for the film\u00a0To the Ends of the Earth\u00a0(1948).  Because of his appearance and very tall frame (6 feet, 6 inches), Dierkes enjoyed a long career as a character actor, often portraying villains or soldiers. In the 1953 film\u00a0Shane, Dierkes portrays villain Morgan Ryker, who is the last man shot by the title character, Shane, in the final bar room shootout. One of his more memorable scenes is in the 1960 film,\u00a0The Alamo. Dierkes portrays a Tennessean named Jocko, who is torn between leaving before the attack to care for his blind wife, or staying to support the Texans' cause. Understanding that if Jocko stays to fight she will likely be widowed, Jocko's wife coaxes him to stay and defend the fort, despite her disability.  Dierkes died in 1975 of\u00a0emphesyma\u00a0and was survived by his wife Cynthia, two sons, and two daughters.",
