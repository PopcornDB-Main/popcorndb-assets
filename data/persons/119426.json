She is an expert of both Chinese martial arts\u00a0and\u00a0Beijing-opera\u00a0skills, and was apprenticed under the same master,\u00a0Yu Jim-Yuen, as\u00a0Jackie Chan\u00a0and\u00a0Sammo Hung Kam-Bo\u00a0at the China Drama Academy's Peking Opera School.  Yuen Qiu worked as a stuntwoman and as a night club performer from the late 1960s to early 1970s. She had a small role in the international production,\u00a0The Man with the Golden Gun\u00a0(1974), portraying a student rescuing\u00a0Roger Moore\u00a0as\u00a0James Bond. As there were few opportunities for stuntwomen and barely any prospects for improvement at the time, she got married in 1974 at the age of 24.  After being away from the\u00a0Hong Kong film industry\u00a0for nearly 20 years, she landed a role in\u00a0Kung Fu Hustle\u00a0only by chance. She was only accompanying a junior woman fellow of the China Drama Academy at the audition but the director's eye was on her. Reports show that\u00a0Stephen Chow\u00a0gave her the job after unremitting and persistent persuasion.  Yuen is also in a movie called\u00a0Kung Fu Mahjong, with\u00a0Yuen Wah.",
