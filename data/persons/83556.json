        "biography": "Mang Hoi (Chinese: \u5b5f\u6d77) was another important member of\u00a0Sammo Hung's stunt team during the 80\u2019s \u2013 and often worked with\u00a0Jackie Chan\u00a0and\u00a0Yuen Biao\u00a0in their films as well. Like most of that stunt group, he alternated between stunt work for other actors and appearing in front of the camera as a character. He did have a few major roles though in his career.\u00a0  With his cherubic face and small stature and seemingly good nature he has been very popular with HK film fans. And like many of this group who worked with Jackie or Sammo or Yuen, he was a student at Madame Fan Fok-fa\u2019s Opera School and went on to stunt work before getting more sizable roles.\u00a0  He seems to have retired from films for the most part by the early 90s though he did have a small part in\u00a0Ah Kam\u00a0and\u00a0The Extra. His sister is female kung fu actress\u00a0Kitty Meng Chui. Mang, also, actually won a Best Supporting Acting award for his part in\u00a0Yes Madam. For a time he was the boyfriend of\u00a0Cynthia Rothrock\u00a0and directed part of her action vehicle\u00a0Lady Reporter/Blonde Fury. Was a member of the Sammo Hung Stuntmen's Association.",
