Yang, along with fellow auteurs Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang, was one of the leading film-makers of the Taiwanese New Wave and Taiwanese Cinema.  Yang's singular visual style has been defined by deliberate pacing, long takes, fixed camera, few closeups, empty spaces, and cityscapes. His films prominently feature themes of struggle between tradition and modernity, and between business and art, set against the backdrop of an evolving Taiwanese society.",
