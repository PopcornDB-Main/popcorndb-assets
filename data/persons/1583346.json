        "biography": "Award-winning veteran actor/writer/producer Tony Winters' career has spanned decades with his work on stage, screen and television but he has recently been discovered by whole new generation of rabid fans. His outstanding work as the tough-as-nails \"Assistant Coach\" in the best selling video games NBA 2K15 and the Spike Lee directed NBA 2K16 has made him iconic amongst gamers. However, his artistic journey began long ago. After graduation from Detroit's Redford High School Winters headed west to attend San Diego City College and later the University of California San Diego. It was there he was bitten by the acting bug and began his theatrical training in earnest. He was first cast in a supporting role in \"Little Murders\" and later in the lead role of Axel in Woody Allen's \"Don't Drink The Water\". But college theater was not enough for the eager thespian, so he looked beyond City's small campus and found a thriving African American theater scene and a mentor in the person of Dr. Floyd Gaffney. Under Gaffney, he tackled a succession of pivotal roles; Brick in \"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\", Lou in \"Spell #7\", Prince in \"Moon On A Rainbow Shawl\" and Homer in \"The Lilies Of The Field\". He even appeared in the musicals \"Guys And Dolls\" and \"Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope\".",
