Raised in her grandmother's brothel, Piaf was discovered in 1935 by nightclub owner Louis Leplee, who persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness.

In 2006, he played a director of a summer camp in the comedy Nos jours bonheurs, by \u00c9ric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, before playing Louis Gassion in the biographical film La M\u00f4me (2007), by Olivier Dahan.\n\nDuring the 2010s, he especially won the role of Jeff Tuche, in the series of successful comedies Les Tuche directed by Olivier Baroux.
