        "biography": "Legendary Hollywood Icon Harrison Ford was born on July 13,\u00a01942 in Chicago, Illinois. His family\u00a0history includes a strong lineage of actors, radio personalities, and models.\u00a0Ford attended public high school in Park\u00a0Ridge, Illinois where he was a member of the school Radio Station WMTH.\u00a0Ford worked as the lead voice for sports reporting at WMTH for several\u00a0years.\u00a0Acting wasn't a major interest to\u00a0Ford until his junior year at Ripon College when he first took an acting class. Ford's career started in 1964 when he travelled to\u00a0California in search of a voice-over job.\u00a0He never received that position, but instead signed a contract with\u00a0Columbia Pictures where he earned $150 weekly to play small fill in roles in\u00a0various films.\n\nThrough the '60s Ford\u00a0worked on several TV shows including Gunsmoke,\u00a0Ironside, Kung Fu, and American Style. It wasn't until 1967 that he received\u00a0his first credited role in the Western film, A Time for Killing. Dissatisfied with the meager roles he was being\u00a0offered, Ford took a hiatus from acting to work as a self-employed carpenter.\u00a0This seemingly odd diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise for\u00a0Harrison's acting career when he was soon hired by famous film producer George\u00a0Lucas. This was a turning point in\u00a0Ford's life that led to him be casted in milestone roles such as Han Solo\u00a0and Indiana Jones.\n\nSince his most famous\u00a0roles in the original Star Wars trilogy and Raiders\u00a0of the Lost Ark, Ford has appeared in over 40 films. Many criticize his late-career work, saying his\u00a0performances have been lackluster, leading to commercially disappointing films. Ford has always worked hard to protect his off-screen\u00a0private life, keeping details about his children and marriages quiet. He has a total of five children including one\u00a0recent adoption with third and current wife Calista Flockhart. In addition to\u00a0acting, Ford is passionate about environmental conservation, aviation,\u00a0and archeology.",
