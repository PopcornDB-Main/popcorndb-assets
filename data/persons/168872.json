On April 11, 2011 Jesse appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno alongside Jamie Foxx. Despite his age, he still portrays teenagers and young adults as an extra. As a play on the Go Daddy commercial, singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 cast Heiman in the opening scene of his video \"It's a Beautiful Day\" where Bubl\u00e9 walks in on Jaime Pressly, who plays his significant other in the comical video, and Heiman sharing a kiss, to which Bubl\u00e9 responds by singing the song.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jesse Heiman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
