        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  \u00a0\n\nEvalyn Knapp (June 17, 1906 \u2013 June 12, 1981) was an American film actress of the late 1920s, 1930s, and into the 1940s. She was a leading B-movie serial actress in the 1930s.\n\nBorn as Evelyn Pauline Knapp in Kansas City, Missouri in 1906, Knapp started acting in silent films, her first role being in the 1929 film At The Dentist's. In 1932, Knapp was one of fourteen girls, including Ginger Rogers and Gloria Stuart, selected as \"WAMPAS Baby Stars\".\n\nKnapp achieved success in cliffhanger serials, which were popular at the time. She played the title character in the 1933 serial The Perils of Pauline. One of her better known film roles was opposite Ken Maynard in the 1934 film In Old Santa Fe. Her career flourished through 1941, but slowed afterward. In 1943, she played her last role, which was uncredited, in Two Weeks To Live, starring Chester Lauck and Norris Goff in one of the Lum and Abner films.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Evalyn Knapp, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.  \u200b",
