On television she appeared as a regular on such series as Cafe Americain, All American Girl and Miss Match, all of which were short-lived.\n\nIn addition to her credited roles, Long appeared uncredited in a brief black-and-white cut-scene in the music video for Bizarre Love Triangle by the British group New Order, directed by American artist Robert Longo, in which she argues with E. Max Frye (where she emphatically declares \"I don't believe in reincarnation because I refuse to come back as a bug or as a rabbit!\").\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article \u00a0Jodi Long, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
