        "biography": "William James \"Bill\" Murray is an American actor, comedian, and writer. He is known for his deadpan delivery in roles ranging from studio comedies to independent dramas. He has frequently collaborated with directors Ivan Reitman, Harold Ramis, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Jim Jarmusch. He has earned numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, two Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and two Independent Spirit Awards, as well as a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2016, Murray was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.\n\nMurray was born in Evanston, Illinois, to Lucille (1921\u20131988), a mail-room clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II (1921\u20131967), a lumber salesman. He was raised in Wilmette, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Murray and his eight siblings grew up in an Irish Catholic family. His paternal grandfather was from County Cork, while his maternal ancestors were from County Galway. Three of his siblings, John Murray, Joel Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, are also actors.\n\nMurray attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, where he studied pre-med for a year. He dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. In 1973, he moved to New York City to pursue a career in comedy. He joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour, and later appeared in the National Lampoon stage show Lemmings.\n\nIn 1977, Murray joined the cast of Saturday Night Live. He quickly became one of the show's most popular cast members, known for his deadpan delivery and his ability to improvise. He left the show in 1980 to pursue a film career.\n\nMurray's first major film role was in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. He went on to star in a number of successful comedies, including Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Ghostbusters (1984), and Groundhog Day (1993). He has also starred in a number of critically acclaimed dramas, such as Lost in Translation (2003) and Broken Flowers (2005).\n\nMurray is known for his eccentric and unpredictable behavior. He has been known to disappear from sets and film projects, and he has often been quoted as saying that he doesn't like to work. However, he is also known for his generosity and his willingness to help out his fellow actors.",
