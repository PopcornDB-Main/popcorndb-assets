In college, Mwinga took his first acting class on his mother's advice, and he immediately loved it.\n\nMwinga had several small roles in theater, films, and television. He had a role in London's West End production of the play Sweet Charity. In 2012, Mwinga had his first big role in a film, as the rebel leader Grand Tigre Royal in Kim Nguyen's War Witch. The film deals with child soldiers in sub-Saharan Africa, and Mwinga's character believes that Komona (Rachel Mwanza) in a sorceress. In order to play the role, Mwinga had to learn to speak the Lingala language, taking months of practice.

War Witch received several awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In 2013, Mwinga had a small part in White House Down.
