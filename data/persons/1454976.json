In Our Little Sister she stars as a football playing teenager who gets adopted into the Kamakura home of her elder half-sisters after the death of their alienated father. The Kouda sisters first meet her at the funeral in the town where he settled for his second marriage. The film was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or enabling Hirose to attend the Cannes Film Festival. For her performance as Suzu she was awarded the Japan Academy Prize for \"Newcomer of the Year\" and received the \"Best New Actress\" award from Kinema Junpo, among other accolades. Hirose and Koreeda collaborated again for The Third Murder.\n\nIn March 2016 Hirose first appeared as a competitive karuta and Ogura Hyakunin Isshu poetry obsessed high school student in part one of Norihiro Koizumi's (\u5c0f\u6cc9\u5fb3\u5b8f Koizumi Norihiro) Awesome film series, performing the lead role of Chihaya Ayase in his big-screen, live-action, adaptation of cartoonist Yuki Suetsugu's comic strip, better known in English under its romanised Japanese title Chihayafuru.
