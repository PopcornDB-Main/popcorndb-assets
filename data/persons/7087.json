The answer lies up in the stratosphere, where cloud people sculpt babies from clouds and bring them to life. Gus, a lonely and insecure grey cloud, is a master at creating \"dangerous\" babies. Crocodiles, porcupines, rams and more - Gus's beloved creations are works of art, but more than a handful for his loyal delivery stork partner, Peck. As Gus's creations become more and more rambunctious, Peck's job gets harder and harder. How will Peck manage to handle both his hazardous cargo and his friend's fiery temperament?",

        "biography": "Phillip Bradley \"Brad\" Bird (born September 15, 1957) is an American director, voice actor, animator and screenwriter. He is best known for writing and directing Disney/Pixar's The Incredibles (2004), its sequel Incredibles 2 (2018), and Ratatouille (2007). He also adapted and directed the critically acclaimed 2D animated 1999 Warner Brothers film The Iron Giant. Reviewing the Ratatouille DVD, Eye Weekly offered this characterization of Bird's work: \"It's very hard to think of another mainstream American director with a comparably fluid visual style or such a vise-grip on storytelling mechanics.\" He also directed The Simpsons ' episodes \"Krusty Gets Busted\" and \"Like Father, Like Clown\".\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Brad Bird, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
