        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nEnzo G. Castellari (born July 29, 1938) is an Italian film director. He became famous during the 1960s by directing several spaghetti westerns with such titles as Go Kill and Come Back (Vado... l'ammazzo e torno, 1967) , One Dollar Too Many (1968), Seven Winchesters for a Massacre (Sette winchester per un massacro, 1967) and Go Kill Everybody and Come Back Alone (Ammazzali tutti e torna solo, 1968). His films exhibited a flair for violent action and gunfights, often using slow-motion to spectacular effect. His film Keoma (1976) is considered the last great film of the genre.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Enzo G.
