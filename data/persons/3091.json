At the age of 36, he made his screen debut in the television film The Hanged Man. Lettieri acted with some of Hollywood's biggest screen names including Steve McQueen in The Getaway, Charles Bronson in Mr. Majestyk, John Wayne in McQ and both Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in The Godfather.\n\nLettieri died of a heart attack in 1975, at the age of 47, leaving two children.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article \u00a0Al Lettieri, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
