He was one of only 9 children being considered. It was a great trip and jump started his young career. He has since been in numerous commercials as well as a TV pilot and short film. Marc's breakthrough came in September of 2002 when New Line Cinema needed two little boys to play Robert Duvall and Michael Caine's nephews in Secondhand Lions (2003) (New Line Cinemas hopeful for an Oscar in 2003). Marc was fortunate enough to not only get the part but also to play opposite his own real life brother Mitchel Musso. Just two weeks after finishing \"Secondhand Lions\", Marc was cast in 21 Grams (2003) playing Benicio Del Toro's son \"Freddy\". This film also stars Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. He has also done several National commercials. IMDb Mini Biography By: Katherine Musso\u00a0\n\nTrivia Younger brother of Mitchel Musso\n\nYounger brother of Mason Musso.",
