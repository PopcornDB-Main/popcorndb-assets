        "biography": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auburtin (born 4 June 1962) is a French director, writer, actor and producer.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auburtin was born and grew up in Marseille, where he studied music (piano, drums) and literature before turning to the cinema in the early 80s. He made his debut as an assistant director in the film Rouge midi, directed by Robert Gu\u00e9diguian.\n\nIn the 80s and 90s he worked as an assistant director in several movies and with several directors, including Maurice Pialat (Under the Sun of Satan), Luigi Comencini (La Boh\u00e8me), Richard Heffron (La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise), Bertrand Blier (Merci la vie), Jean-Jacques Annaud (The Lover), Claude Berri (Germinal and Lucie Aubrac), Jean-Paul Rappeneau (The Horseman on the Roof) and Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask).\n\nIn 1999, he debuted as a director, co-directing Un pont entre deux rives with G\u00e9rard Depardieu, for which he also composed the soundtrack. During the 2000s he keep directing mostly for television, but also directed movies, including San-Antonio (2004) and Envoy\u00e9s tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9ciaux (2009). In 2006, he co-directed (again with Depardieu) the segment \"Quartier Latin\", written and starred by Gena Rowlands with Ben Gazzara and G\u00e9rard Depardieu, in the highly acclaimed movie Paris, je t'aime.\n\nIn 2014, he became widely known for directing the infamous movie United Passions. The film recounts the origins of the world-governing body of association football, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association, and was ninety-percent funded by them. Released in North America at the peak of the scandals of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, the film grossed very badly in the box-office (a mere $918 in its opening weekend) and received overwhelming dislike from critics around the world. It's now considered one of the worst movies ever made and all the actors and Auburtin himself considered the film a \"disaster\".\n\nSource: Article \"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auburtin\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
