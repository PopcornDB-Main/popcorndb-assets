Eleven of her singles (including two platinum) and 14 of her albums (including two platinum and four double platinum) have been certified gold by the RIAA. She has sold an estimated over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nIn 1978, she co-starred with John Travolta in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical, Grease, which became one of the most successful films and movie soundtracks in Hollywood history. It features two major hit\u00a0duets\u00a0with co-star\u00a0John Travolta: \"You're the One That I Want\"\u2014which is one of the\u00a0best-selling singles of all time\u2014and \"Summer Nights\".\n\nShe became the second woman (after\u00a0Linda Ronstadt\u00a0in 1977) to have two singles \u2013 \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" and \"Summer Nights\" \u2013 in the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0top 5 simultaneously. Her performance earned her a\u00a0People's Choice Award\u00a0for Favorite Film Actress. She was nominated for a\u00a0Golden Globe\u00a0as Best Actress in a Musical and performed the Oscar-nominated \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" at the 1979\u00a0Academy Awards.\n\nIn 1980, she starred with\u00a0Gene Kelly\u00a0and\u00a0Michael Beck\u00a0in the musical fantasy film Xanadu. Although it was a critical failure,\u00a0its soundtrack\u00a0was certified double platinum and scored five top 20 singles on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100. She charted with \"Magic\", \"Suddenly\" with\u00a0Cliff Richard, and the title song \"Xanadu\" with the\u00a0Electric Light Orchestra.\n\n\"Magic\" was Newton-John's biggest pop hit to that point\u00a0and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career. The film has since become a cult classic and the basis for a\u00a0Broadway show\u00a0that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four\u00a0Tony Awards\u00a0including Best Musical.\n\nShe helped pioneer the music video industry by recording a\u00a0video album for Physical, featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special,\u00a0Let's Get Physical,\u00a0becoming a top-10\u00a0Nielsen\u00a0hit.\n\nShe teamed up with Travolta again in 1983 for the critically and commercially unsuccessful movie\u00a0Two of a Kind, redeemed by its platinum soundtrack featuring \"Twist of Fate\",\u00a0and a new duet with Travolta, \"Take a Chance\"Iowa.\u00a0\n\nIn 2002, she was inducted into Australia's\u00a0ARIA Hall of Fame and, in\u00a02015, she was inducted into the\u00a0Music Victoria Hall of Fame.
