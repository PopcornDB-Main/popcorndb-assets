        "biography": "Josefa Cotillo Mart\u00ednez, La Polaca, (Madrid, June 16, 1944 - Seville, June 2, 2010) was a Spanish dancer and actress.\n\nShe was born in the Lavapi\u00e9s neighborhood of Madrid. After leaving her studies at the age of ten, she began to dedicate herself to flamenco dancing and created her own style in an absolutely self-taught way. At the age of twelve, she made her debut as a professional in the play \u201cLa Parrilla\u201d, at the Alc\u00e1zar theater in Madrid. At the age of sixteen, she went to America as part of the company of the dancer Jos\u00e9 Greco, in which she quickly became one of the main figures. Her nickname is attributed to her dancing a Polish dance.\n\nAt the end of the fifties she toured the Soviet Union, Europe, and the United States, where she appeared on the Ed Sullivan show and performed before President Kennedy. Back in Spain, she consolidated her upward career with successive tours and reached the status of leading figure in flamenco ballets such as \u201cLos canasteros\u201d and \u201cLas brujas\u201d.\n\nShe made her film debut in 1965 with the film \u201cCon el viento solano\u201d, by Mario Camus. Throughout the seventies she participated in various titles giving life to passionate characters through which she frequently exhibited her dancing skills. Among the films in which she intervenes are \u201cEl amor brujo\u201d (1967), by Rovira-Beleta; \u201cThe Secretaries\u201d (1969), by Pedro Lazaga; and \u201cDel amor y la muerte\u201d (1977), by Antonio Gim\u00e9nez-Rico. In 1978 she appeared as a judge on the dance contest \u201cFiebre del 2\u201d, a Mexican program on Televisa. At the turn of the decade, in the eighties, her career began to decline, although she would still participate in Carlos Saura's new version of El amor brujo (1986).",
