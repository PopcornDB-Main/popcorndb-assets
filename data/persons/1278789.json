Just a few weeks later, without any acting background, he found himself in Europe on a five-month shoot, as a principal actor in 47 Ronin, starring in one-on-one scenes with Keanu Reeves! Japanese-born Yonemoto is a classic Hollywood miracle. Educated in Japan, he worked in a mental hospital before coming to study in the U.S. A long-term film buff, Yonemoto now appears on the big-screen himself, for a worldwide audience, and today is one of the premiere up-and-coming Asian stars on the global scene.",
