        "biography": "Born in Columbus, Ohio in 1937, Bill attended Grandview Heights High  School and the Ohio State University where he majored in fine arts  hoping to get into advertising or cartooning. Among his many mementos  are a sheaf of rejection slips from The New Yorker and Playboy. He was  introduced to the theatre by volunteering to design the set for a  friend's student production. He worked on the art staff of the OSU  Motion Pictures Department and the University TV station, WOSU. In 1963,  after the usual summer stock assignments, he arrived in New York City,  where he worked at NBC as a page and as a production assistant. He  became a backstage jack-of-all-trades with The New York Shakespeare  Festival, The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, and many other regional and  off-Broadway theater groups.\n\nIn 1966 he was hired by Peter  Schickele as the stage manager for PDQ Bach, and became known to  thousands of concert goers in New York and around the country as the  irascible and irritable but always efficient apologist for Schickele's  satiric presentations of the infamous \"Evening of Musical Madness\".  Despite his crusty on-stage persona, Bill was for 46 years the technical  coordinator, production manager, road manager, and the REAL stage  manager of the series of concerts that had its first public performance  in 1965 at Town Hall in New York. He once said that he felt like Sky  Masterson, the gambler-hero of \"Guys and Dolls\", who noted that: \"There  are two things that have been in every hotel room in America: Sky  Masterson and the Gideon Bible.\"\n\nWalters continues to work in  concerts, theatre, dabbles in background work in movies and TV, writes  lots of unproduced plays and film scripts, and teaches film-making and  video with kids. He also works for Gray Line New York Sightseeing as a  tour guide riding around on the top of a double-decker bus telling lies  about New York City to gullible and unwary tourists.\n\nHe is married to the actress Donegal Browne. Their daughter Samantha Browne-Walters is also an actress.",
