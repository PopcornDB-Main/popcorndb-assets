        "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nFrederick Arthur Round \"Fred\" Emney (12 February 1900 \u2013 25 December 1980) was an English character actor and comedian.\n\nEmney was born in Prescot, Lancashire, the son of Blanche (n\u00e9e Round) and Fred Emney, a music hall entertainer. His great-uncle was the actor Arthur Williams. Emney junior grew up in London and was educated at Cranleigh School.\n\nHe made his film debut in 1935, having previously worked in music hall. He became a familiar figure to screen audiences, usually playing the \"posh fat bloke\", usually gruff and invariably wearing a monocle. During the 1950s, he had his own television show which featured sketches and deft piano pieces often composed by him. Some were released on record. He had a short spell as straight man to puppets Pinky and Perky.\n\nHis sister Joan Emney was an actress who sometimes appeared with him in the same stage productions.\n\nFred Emney died in Bognor Regis, Sussex on Christmas Day 1980.",
