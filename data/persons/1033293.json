Her childhood film career spanned 16 movies, but she is best  remembered for playing the daughter of George and Mary Bailey (James Stewart and Donna Reed).  The petals from her rose symbolize the values of family, friends and  life itself in the 1946 classic, and it is Zuzu who speaks the movie's  most memorable line, \"Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\"  In recent years, Karolyn has carried on the spirit of It's a Wonderful Life (1946), serving as the film's most active and appealing ambassador.",
