Hall (born November 10, 1937) is an American actor.\n\nBorn in Brighton, Alabama, Hall graduated from the Columbia University School of the Arts in 1971. That same year he appeared Off-Broadway in The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and on Broadway in the Melvin Van Peebles musical Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death. His most famous film role to date is probably that of Chief Phillips in Francis Ford Coppola's award-winning Apocalypse Now. Contemporary audiences may recognise Hall as stern judge Seymore Walsh, a recurring guest-role, on Ally McBeal and The Practice. Hall also has made guest appearances on Kojak, Miami Vice, Matlock, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Strong Medicine, 24, Sleeper Cell and Grey's Anatomy.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Albert Hall, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
