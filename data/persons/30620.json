She went on to have a prolific career as a television actress throughout the 1980s.\n\nBorn in Manila, Philippines to American parents, Raines was primarily raised in Florida. After graduating high school, she relocated to New York City to pursue a career as a model, and signed with the Ford Modeling Agency.

Raines also co-starred in Ridley Scott's directorial debut, The Duellists (1977), a period piece based on the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nRaines had her first major television role in the twelve-part miniseries Centennial (1978), playing the daughter of a fur trapper in 1800s Colorado.
