Chaplin received her second Golden Globe nomination for Robert Altman's Nashville (1975). She received a BAFTA nomination for her role in Welcome to L. A. (1976). She played her grandmother Hannah Chaplin in the biopic Chaplin (1992), for which she received her third Golden Globe nomination. Chaplin has appeared in a wide variety of critically recognized Spanish and French films. She starred in Les Uns et les Autres (1981), Life Is a Bed of Roses (1983) and the Jacques Rivette experimental films Noro\u00eet (1976) and Love on the Ground (1984).\n\nShe was the partner of director Carlos Saura for 12 years until 1979, starring in his films Ana and the Wolves (1973), Cr\u00eda Cuervos (1976), Elisa, vida m\u00eda (1977), and Mam\u00e1 cumple cien a\u00f1os (1979).
