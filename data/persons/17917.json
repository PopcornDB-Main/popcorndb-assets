He's also known for his role as radio operator Russell Vossler in\u00a0Crimson Tide\u00a0(1995), and as Benitez in\u00a0Renaissance Man\u00a0(1994). He also portrayed Matthew Bevilaqua, a young mobster on The Sopranos.  In December 2005, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder for his role in a burglary in the Bronx, New York. Authorities say that an off-duty police officer, Daniel Enchautegui, confronted two burglars and was killed in a shootout. Brancato was subsequently acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of first-degree attempted burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Co-defendant Steven Armento was convicted of firing the fatal shot. On December 31, 2013, he was released on parole.\n\nHe has continued to appear in movies.",
