He created, wrote and produced After Innocence, which won the special jury award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, before going on to receive other numerous recognitions, including its selection as a semi-finalist for Best Feature Documentary at the 78th Academy Awards. Nursery University (2008) marked Simon\u2019s feature directorial debut. The film, which premiered at Toronto's Hot Docs Film Festival, was the top-grossing independent film during its opening theatrical weekend, and has been broadcast throughout the world. The documentary Unraveled (2011) is Simon\u2019s second straight directing effort and third as a producer. The film centers around prominent laywer, Marc Dreier, who was arrested for orchestrating a massive fraud scheme that netted hundreds of millions of dollars from hedge funds.\n\nSimon is also a leading independent film attorney serving as lead counsel for films such as Winter's Bone, The Kids Are All Right, and Werner Herzog\u2019s Cave of Forgotten Dreams.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Marc H.
