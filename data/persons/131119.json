Koch labeled \u201c...the most vicious crime in New York City history\u201d (1981) which involved a nun who was raped and tortured in an East Harlem convent as 27 crosses were carved into her by two men, who later confessed and were convicted. \u00a0The second was the Palm Sunday Massacre in 1984, which was one of New York City\u2019s most bloody mass slayings, of ten people. \u00a0Bo was instrumental in the arrest and conviction of the suspects in both cases.  Bo is the co-author of the book \u201cOne Tough Cop\u201d, which is a story about his life as a New York City police detective. \u00a0The movie version of \u201cOne Tough Cop\u201d was made into a major motion picture. Bo\u2019s next book, entitled \u201cBusiness Lunchatations\u201d, a story about networking and business strategies hit stores in April 2005, ranking #5 on Amazon\u2019s Business Best Seller List. \u00a0Since then, Bo has embraced many faceted roles in the industry such as Associate Producer for the movie \u201cThe Bone Collector\u201d and Producer for the movie \u201cTable One.\u201d \u00a0Bo entered into the television realm as an Executive Producer of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Runner\u201d which was to be released back in 2002. \u00a0He also was Executive Producer of \u201cThe Gray Area\u201d on CBS TV.",
