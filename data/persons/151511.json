        "biography": "Arthur Batanides (April 9, 1923 \u2013 January 10, 2000) was an American film and television actor, originally from Tacoma, Washington. He became enamored with acting after performing stand-up routines in front of fellow GIs in Europe during World War II. He was educated in dramatic art at the Actors' Lab in Los Angeles, followed by extensive stage experience.\n\nOne of his more recognizable television roles was that of the unfortunate Starfleet officer/geologist D'Amato in the Star Trek episode \"That Which Survives\". Among his film credits are The Unearthly, Violent Road, The Leech Woman, Man-Trap, The Maltese Bippy, Evil Roy Slade and Brannigan. He also appeared as Mr. Kirkland in four of the Police Academy film series, and the sixth installment (City Under Siege) was his final acting appearance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
