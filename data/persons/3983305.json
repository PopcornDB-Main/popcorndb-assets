Though Christy is a spastic quadriplegic and essentially paralyzed, a miraculous event occurs when, at the age of 5, he demonstrates control of his left foot by using chalk to scrawl a word on the floor. With the help of his steely mother \u2014 and no shortage of grit and determination \u2014 Christy overcomes his infirmity to become a painter, poet and author.",
