        "biography": "\u200bFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \u00a0\n\nAlexander Chaplin (born March 20, 1971) is an American actor. Chaplin's most prominent role was that of speechwriter James Hobert on the sitcom Spin City. He was born as Alexander Gaberman in New York City.\n\nAs with the rest of the Spin City main cast, Chaplin has featured in creator Bill Lawrence's subsequent sitcom, Scrubs, playing a drug addict who tries to trick Elliot into giving him prescription medication in \"My Moment of Un-Truth\" and later tricks Jordan into giving him money in \"My Rite of Passage\". His character later appeared in \"My Scrubs\" as a drugs counsellor for the hospital, claiming to be reformed.\n\nChaplin also appeared in an episode of Law & Order (Season 14, episode 1, \"Bodies\") as pompous yet ethical legal-aid attorney Timothy Schwimmer who has to defend a serial killer (played by Ritchie Coster). Chaplin's character ends up on the stand for not disclosing information, protected by the attorney-client privilege, given to him by the serial killer.\n\nAs a teen, Chaplin attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alexander Chaplin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
