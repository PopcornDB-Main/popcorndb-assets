Born in Japan to English parents, Edwin Eddison and Hilda Muriel Leadham, he had a twin brother Talbot Leadam Eddison. Through his paternal grandmother, Anna Paulina Tatham of Philadelphia, he was related to the Tatham Brothers Iron pipe manufacturers of Philadelphia. As his paternal great-grandfather Henry Billington Tatham's name suggests, he was a descendant of the Billington family who came to America from England on the Mayflower.  Eddison was known for his resonant, baritone voice and long, lean figure. He performed\u00a0William Shakespeare\u00a0and other classics, was noted for his\u00a0Hamlet\u00a0at the\u00a0Old Vic, and later playing the comic roles of\u00a0Feste\u00a0and\u00a0Sir Andrew Aguecheek\u00a0inTwelfth Night, and\u00a0King Lear\u00a0on the\u00a0New York\u00a0stage. He was also a familiar figure in plays by\u00a0Ibsen,\u00a0Chekhov, andSophocles, and played\u00a0Canon Chasuble\u00a0in\u00a0Oscar Wilde's\u00a0The Importance of Being Earnest.  Eddison also made his mark in radio, in countless\u00a0BBC\u00a0dramas through the decades, with some of his last roles includingDeath\u00a0in\u00a0The Canterbury Tales\u00a0and parts in an adaptation of Japanese\u00a0Noh\u00a0plays. His film career was limited, but included a supporting role in\u00a0Peter Ustinov's\u00a01948 comedy\u00a0Vice Versa, the electrical 'Nick' in\u00a0The Boy Who Turned Yellow\u00a0(1972), the college president in\u00a0American Friends\u00a0(1991), and a notable cameo in\u00a0Indiana Jones and the Last Crusadeas the ancient Grail Knight, warning adventurers to choose wisely.",
