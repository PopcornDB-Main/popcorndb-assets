A founding member of the hip hop group the Wu-Tang Clan, GZA is the group's \"spiritual head\", being both the oldest and the first in the group to receive a record deal. He has appeared on his fellow Clan members' solo projects, and has maintained a successful solo career starting with Liquid Swords (1995).\n\nHis lyrical style often dismisses typical rap story lines in favor of science and wide-ranging philosophies and has been characterized as \"armed with sharp metaphors and a smooth flow\". An analysis of GZA's lyrics found that he has the fourth largest vocabulary in popular hip hop music. He teamed up with an education group to promote science education in New York City through hip hop.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.",
