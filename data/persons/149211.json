Born in Liverpool, England, Watkins trained as a neurosurgeon and became one of the most respected doctors in his field. In 1978, he was appointed as Formula 1\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, where he began implementing critical safety improvements.\n\nWatkins advocated for and introduced numerous life-saving practices, including on-site medical teams, improved medical facilities at tracks, and the deployment of rapid-response vehicles. His friendship with drivers like Ayrton Senna and Niki Lauda was well-known, and he was often the first on the scene to assist injured drivers. Watkins\u2019 efforts helped save lives and led to the creation of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, where he served as chairman.\n\nWatkins\u2019 legacy is monumental in motorsport safety, transforming Formula 1 into a much safer sport. His contributions are widely respected, and he is remembered as the \u201cGuardian Angel\u201d of Formula 1 drivers, with his work continuing to protect lives even after his passing in 2012.",
