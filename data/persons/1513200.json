Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. Most of this was generally considered to be their father's fault. \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" is the story of the family's sudden, unexpected reunion one recent winter.",
