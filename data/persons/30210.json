        "biography": "Jean Arthur (October 17, 1900 \u2013 June 19, 1991) was an American actress and a major film star of the 1930s and 1940s. She remains arguably the epitome of the female screwball comedy actress. As James Harvey wrote in his recounting of the era, \"No one was more closely identified with the screwball comedy than Jean Arthur. So much was she part of it, so much was her star personality defined by it, that the screwball style itself seems almost unimaginable without her.\" Arthur has been called \"the quintessential comedic leading lady.\"\n\nArthur is best known for her feature roles in three Frank Capra films: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can't Take It With You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), films that championed the everyday heroine. Her last performance was the memorable\u2014and distinctly non\u2013comedic\u2014role as the rancher's wife in George Stevens' Shane (1953).\n\nArthur was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944 for her performance in The More the Merrier (1943).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean Arthur, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
