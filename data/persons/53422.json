Puccini is perhaps best known for playing a lead role in 2003 in the Italian soap opera Elisa di Rivombrosa. Puccini and Alessandro Preziosi, a fellow actor on Elisa di Rivombrosa, had a daughter together in 2006. Puccini's role as Mafalda in the 2007 Rai Uno miniseries Le ragazze di San Frediano cast her among many other well-known Italian actresses, including Martina Stella, Chiara Conti, and Camilla Filippi. Her 2009 projects include the television miniseries Tutta la verit\u00e0.
