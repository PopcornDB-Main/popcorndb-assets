        "biography": "Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Megan Hayes knew from a young age, that entertaining would be her calling. Megan spent most of her youth either playing superhero, while in her Wonder Woman Underoos or looking like a boy in a dress.\n\nAt 15 she discovered that an audience's laughter is a euphoric drug, when she starred in her high school production of The Pajama Game. This performance sealed her fate, to pursue a life as an actor. After high school, Megan attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, wondering all the while, \"What am I doing in the middle of Amish Farmland?\" After her freshman year at Kenyon, she transferred to New York University's Tisch School of the Art, where she studied at the Experimental Theatre Wing.\n\nAfter graduating with honors in Acting, Megan began writing and performing her own work. She started Southern Belle Productions (SBP), a company dedicated to giving a voice to emerging artists. SBP produced a short film, several One Acts and Megan's own full-length play, Opelika, which had two sold out runs in New York. Despite loving New York and all that it had to offer, Megan decided to move back to Atlanta, which was a great decision considering this is where her film and television career truly got its start.\n\nWhile continuing to do countless theater projects, Megan was cast in HBO's Eastbound and Down, What to Expect When You Are Expecting, the IFC thriller +1, from the director of The Last House on the Left Dennis Iliadis, as well as numerous commercials and TV guest spots. However, as luck would have it, the second film in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire, was shooting in Atlanta. Megan was cast as The Morphling, the tribute from District 6.\n\nNow in Los Angeles, Megan continues to hone her craft, acting in all mediums, teaching drama, and writing. Megan loves dogs, and had two pups of her own, one now lives with her family in Atlanta. She is also passionate about bringing awareness to the stigma attached to Mental Health issues, as her father suffered from them for many years.",
