Regarded as a\u00a0pop icon\u00a0and an influential figure in\u00a0popular music, Grande is known for her four-octave\u00a0vocal range, which extends into the\u00a0whistle register.\u00a0Her accolades\u00a0include two\u00a0Grammy Awards, a\u00a0Brit Award, two\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Music Awards, three\u00a0American Music Awards, 39\u00a0Guinness World Records, and ten\u00a0MTV Video Music Awards. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists and vocalists by publications such as\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0and\u00a0Billboard. Grande has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the\u00a0best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nShe began her career as a teenage actress by appearing in the\u00a0Broadway\u00a0musical\u00a013\u00a0(2008). She rose to fame as\u00a0Cat Valentine\u00a0in the\u00a0Nickelodeon television series\u00a0Victorious\u00a0(2010\u20132013) and its spin-off series\u00a0Sam & Cat\u00a0(2013\u20132014). Grande signed with\u00a0Republic Records\u00a0and released her\u00a0retro-pop and\u00a0R&B-influenced debut studio album,\u00a0Yours Truly\u00a0(2013), which debuted at number one on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200. She blended pop, R&B, and\u00a0electronic\u00a0on her second and third albums,\u00a0My Everything\u00a0(2014) and\u00a0Dangerous Woman\u00a0(2016), which both achieved international success and contained the singles \"Problem\", \"Break Free\", \"Bang Bang\", \"One Last Time\", \"Into You\" and \"Side to Side\".\n\nPersonal struggles influenced Grande's\u00a0trap-infused albums\u00a0Sweetener\u00a0(2018) and\u00a0Thank U, Next\u00a0(2019). The former won Grande her first\u00a0Grammy\u00a0award, while the latter garnered US number-one singles \"Thank U, Next\" and \"7 Rings\", and made her the first solo artist to occupy the top three spots of the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100. She subsequently achieved the\u00a0most number-one debuts\u00a0in Hot 100 chart history with the\u00a0title track\u00a0of her sixth album,\u00a0Positions\u00a0(2020), as well as the collaborations \"Stuck with U\" and \"Rain on Me\". After a musical hiatus, Grande released her seventh album,\u00a0Eternal Sunshine\u00a0(2024), which yielded the US number-one singles \"Yes, And?\" and \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\". She returned to film acting with the political satire\u00a0Don't Look Up\u00a0(2021) and received critical praise for her portrayal of\u00a0Glinda\u00a0in the fantasy musical\u00a0Wicked\u00a0(2024), earning her a nomination for the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nSix of Grande's albums have reached number one on the US\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200, while nine of her songs have topped the US\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100, obtaining the most number-one duets in the country. According to\u00a0Forbes, she was the\u00a0world's highest-paid female musician\u00a0in 2020, and among the\u00a0Forbes\u00a0Celebrity 100\u00a0in 2019 and 2020, while\u00a0Time\u00a0included her on its\u00a0Time\u00a0100\u00a0list of the world's most influential people in 2016 and 2019. Outside of music and acting, Grande has worked with many charitable organisations and advocates for\u00a0animal rights,\u00a0mental health, and\u00a0gender,\u00a0racial, and\u00a0LGBT equality. Her business ventures include\u00a0R.E.M. Beauty, a cosmetics brand launched in 2021, and a fragrance line that has earned over $1 billion in global retail sales. She has a large social media following, being the\u00a0sixth-most-followed individual\u00a0on\u00a0Instagram.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ariana Grande, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
