Upon the death of his Shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad Ibn al-Habib, Dallas became the Shaykh of the Order under the name Shaykh Abdulqadir as-Sufi, the name he was given by his Shaykh. He is still active today (2004) as the leader of the worldwide Murabitun movement of Sufis. He wrote a fictionalized account of his journey into Sufism in a novel, \"The Book of Strangers.\" It is also said that, while living in London in the 1960s, he was friends with Eric Clapton, and gave Clapton a copy of the ancient Persian Sufi parable \"Layla and Majnun,\" which later became the basis for Clapton's song \"Layla\" about his own ill-fated romance.",
