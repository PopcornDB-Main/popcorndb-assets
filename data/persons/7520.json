        "biography": "Jeanette Nolan (December 30, 1911 \u2013 June 5, 1998) was an American actress. Nominated for four Emmy Awards, she had roles in the television series The Virginian (1962\u20131971) and Dirty Sally (1974), and in films such as Macbeth (1948).\n\nNolan began her prolific acting career at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California, and, while a student at Los Angeles City College, made her radio debut in 1932 in Omar Khayyam, the first transcontinental broadcast from station KHJ. She continued acting into the 1990s.\n\nNolan made more than three hundred television appearances, including the religion anthology series, Crossroads and as Dr. Marion in the 1956 episode \"The Healer\" in Brian Keith's CBS Cold War series, Crusader. She appeared on Rod Cameron's syndicated series, State Trooper. Nolan was cast as Emmy Zecker in the 1959 episode \"Johnny Yuma\" of the ABC western series, The Rebel, starring Nick Adams. She appeared in two episodes of David Janssen's crime drama, Richard Diamond, Private Detective. She starred as Maggie Bowers in the Peter Gunn episode \"Love Me to Death\" in 1959. She played Sadie Grimes in Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode titled \"The Right Kind of House\" which first aired March 9, 1958 and Mrs.Edith in \"Coming Home\" June 13, 1961.\n\nNolan graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in her native Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 1935, Nolan married actor John McIntire; the couple remained together until his death in 1991. Nolan and McIntire had two children together, actors Holly and Tim.\n\nNolan and McIntire worked together several times from the late 1960s on, sometimes as voice actors. They appeared in a 1969 KCET television reading of Norman Corwin's 1938 radio play The Plot to Overthrow Christmas, with McIntire as the Devil and Nolan as Lucrezia Borgia.\n\nIn 1977, they appeared in Disney's twenty-third animated film The Rescuers, in which McIntire voiced the cat Rufus and Nolan the muskrat Ellie Mae. Four years later, the couple worked on the 24th Disney film, The Fox and the Hound, with McIntire as the voice of Mr. Digger, an ill-tempered badger, and Nolan as the original voice of Widow Tweed, the old kindly widow who takes in Tod after his mother was killed by an off-screen hunter.\n\nThey guest-starred on screen together, often portraying a married couple, as in an episode of The Love Boat in 1978, Charlie's Angels in 1979, The Incredible Hulk in 1980, Goliath Awaits in 1981, Quincy, M.E. in 1983, and Night Court in 1985, playing Dan Fielding's hick Louisianan parents.\n\nNolan died of a stroke in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on June 5, 1998. She was buried in Eureka, Montana's Tobacco Valley Cemetery.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  CLR",
