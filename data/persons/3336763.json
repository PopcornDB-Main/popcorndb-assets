It was only natural for Felber to secure roles as police officers in films but that was only a microcosm of his roles. Mr. Felber appeared frequently as bar patrons, socialites, and whatever was needed. When he was not collecting a paycheck on set, he was a board member of the Screen Extras Guild trying to improve working conditions for his fellow extras. When it became increasingly more difficult to find work, he retired in the 1980s, he moved to Nevada where he passed away in 2003.",
