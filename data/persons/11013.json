He went to Wyoming Valley West Middle and High Schools and graduated from Wyoming Seminary. Before he received his bachelor's degree from Columbia University, Harris's short film Urban Chaos Theory won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Short Film at the NoDance Film Festival, and the following winter, his short film, \"The Killing of Candice Klein,\"\u00a0played at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nHarris made his feature film directing debut with Imaginary Heroes, starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, and Michelle Williams. The film had its world premiere at the 29th Toronto International Film Festival and opened Winter 2005 after being given special recognition for excellence in filmmaking from the National Board of Review.\n\nIn addition to Superman Returns, Harris and his writing partner Michael Dougherty have co-written many films, including Urban Legends: Bloody Mary and X2, which he wrote at the age of 22 for director Bryan Singer, an assignment offered to him after the director read the screenplay for Imaginary Heroes. In the same year, he was honoured as one of Variety\u2019s top 10 screenwriters to watch.\n\nHarris directed I, Lucifer, a film based on the novel, which he adapted with Michael Dougherty.
