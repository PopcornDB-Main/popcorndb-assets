        "biography": "Italian\u00a0film actress\u00a0whose career spanned nine decades of cinema. She also made a substantial contribution to theatre.  She entered film in 1916 in the silent picture\u00a0Jacobo Ortis\u00a0directed by\u00a0Giuseppe Sterni, and made over 80 film appearances between then and 1990.  Appearing in several silent films before 1921 she was absent from cinema for some 14 years during which time she made numerous stage appearances. She gained notoriety in 1925 when she appeared in a show as a\u00a0mermaid\u00a0exposing her breasts which she saw as natural in the role but caused considerable outrage at the time. She returned to the silver screen in 1936 in the\u00a0Mario Mattoli\u00a0film\u00a0L' Uomo che sorride.  She went on to appear in films such as the\u00a0Carlo Lizzani-directed film\u00a0Ai margini della metropoli\u00a0in 1952 in which she appeared alongside the main cast of\u00a0Massimo Girotti,\u00a0Marina Berti\u00a0and\u00a0Giulietta Masina. Between 1936 and 1956 her career was at its peak and her roles gradually became less numerous in the decades that followed, making a final appearance in the\u00a0Giorgio Mosa\u00a0filmBlue dolphin - l'avventura continua\u00a0in 1990.  She died of a\u00a0stroke\u00a0aged 95 on 9 April 1995. (wikipedia)",
