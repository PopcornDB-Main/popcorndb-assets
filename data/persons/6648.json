Widely considered one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time, his films are known as \"profoundly personal meditations into the myriad struggles facing the psyche and the soul.\"\n\nBergman directed more than 60 films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many films from 1961 onward were filmed on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6. He also had a theatrical career that ran in parallel with his film career. It included periods as Leading Director of the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm and of the Residenztheater in Munich. He directed more than 170 plays. He forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet Andersson, Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnel Lindblom and Max von Sydow.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ingmar Bergman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
