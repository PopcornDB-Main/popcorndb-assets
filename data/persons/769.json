        "biography": "Martin Brest (born August 8, 1951) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. After his feature debut, Going in Style (1979), he directed the action comedies Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and Midnight Run (1988), which were critical and commercial hits. He then directed Scent of a Woman (1992), starring Al Pacino, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, and earned Brest nominations for Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nHe followed it with Meet Joe Black (1998), which received mixed reviews. Brest's next film was Gigli (2003). After disagreements between Brest and Revolution Studios, creative control was taken from him, resulting in a radically re-written and re-shot version of the original film being released, which became his first and only unprofitable film and, in fact, a major box-office bomb and was widely panned. It remains his last film to date.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Martin Brest, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
