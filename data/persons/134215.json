Terzo was also active as a singer, appearing in several operettas.\n\nTerzo made his film debut in 1962, and he soon established himself as one of the most active character actors in the Italian comedy cinema, usually playing, with small variations, the character that made him famous in avanspettacolo, i.e. a man with extremely slow reflexes and a huge speech impediment, which does not allow him to speak before he loudly inhaled and exhaled. He retired in 1992 for health reasons.\n\nSource: Article \"Nino Terzo\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
