Originally a stage actress, she started appearing in English language films in the early 1960s and tended to play serious and anxious looking characters. She first become known internationally for nude scenes in One Summer of Happiness. Other notable roles include Ingmar Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night, The Heroes of Telemark and la Servante.

Jacobsson's film career tailed off in the 1970s, and she died in Vienna, Austria from bone cancer at age 53.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ulla Jacobsson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
