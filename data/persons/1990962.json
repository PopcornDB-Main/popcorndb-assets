Struggling with feelings of inferiority, he doggedly tried out for role after role and happily accepted whatever was offered to him however modest, approaching each with passion and dedication. His gifts were ultimately recognized and rewarded with major roles. White is the only black actor who has played in a lead role in five hit shows on Broadway; John in Miss Saigon; Ken in Smokey Joe's Cafe (he originated the role in London's West End); Coalhouse Walker Jr. in Ragtime: The Musical; Mister in The Color Purple; and King Mufasa in The Lion King.",
