He started out doing hidden camera videos in the 90s and became widely popular in Belgium. He gained great popularity in Belgium and had to stop filming in 2004 because he could no longer play without being recognized; he then came to France to continue his activity. There, as in Switzerland, he acquired a certain celebrity thanks to the dissemination of his hoaxes on Canal+ and internet.\n\nHe made his directorial feature debut in 2018 with the drama film Mon Ket.\n\nHe has two sons: Jack & Jimmy.\n\nHe is trilingual, in addition to French, he speaks Dutch and English.\n\nSource: Article \"Fran\u00e7ois Damiens\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
