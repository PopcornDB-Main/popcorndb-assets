        "biography": "Williemgc (born April 10, 1994) is a Dominican songwriter, actor, better know by his stage name Williemgc. He is nicknamed in most of Latin America as the emperor of verses for being the leader, vocalist and main composer of the kinds group. As a member of kinds, Willie has been a key figure in the popularization of Hip-Hop, Taking top songs in the Dominican Republic charts.\n\nHis early vocation for writing earns him a scholarship from Literature which he later leaves to study music at the Poetic World Vocational School, after passing the proficiency exams. The lack of musical instruments and low resources prevented that it can finish its studies of music. With American rap as the only reference, Williemgc began his first personal projects that could be summed up in playing the rhymes, ordering ideas in search of a lyrical discourse of his own, and debug the flow that years later would distinguish him between the baking rapper Dominican That many called a new school.\n\nIn March of 2014, together with his brother Bryan German, they starred in a project that marks a before and after, not only in rap culture and the hip-hop movement, but also in his country. Williemgc's first presentation - July 19, presented at \"Aqu\u00ed Se Habla Espa\u00f1ol\" would be over seventy people in the audience. But in the future, Willie would set a pattern in history, beyond the rapper. It was not necessary to like rap to listen to Williemgc: for almost all Dominicans, this was the first young voice that kept its humility always ahead. From then until today it became a phenomenon that went far beyond the cultural.\n\nFor Williemgc the year 2016 means another transcendental cycle in his career as Mc and Producer Musical, which starts with concerts in public bars and on the street (for his low resources) in the Dominican Republic.\n\nTo this is added the release of his album \"yo soy MC\" (in April) and truths (in July), In September he resumes his international tour in New York and returns in October for the launching of the first tracks of his next album Hip Hop Truths.",
