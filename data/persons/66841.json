        "biography": "Matthieu Chedid (born 21 December 1971) is a French multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter.\n\nChedid began his career as a session musician playing both acoustic and electric guitar. In the late 1990s, he rose to fame as a singer-songwriter and musician under the alias M (often stylized as -M-), blending Nouvelle Chanson, electronic and rock music. In studio, he experiments with various instruments and electronic music, while on tour as -M- he mostly plays the guitar, and is known for his eccentric outfits and dramatic live performances, sometimes including special effects.\n\nChedid has also performed in the 2005 stage musical Le soldat rose and is part of French-Malian band Lamomali. Since 2018, he has been the most awarded artist at the Victoires de la Musique Awards with 13 awards, tied with Alain Bashung.\n\nMatthieu Chedid was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, France. His father Louis Chedid is a singer from a family of Lebanese and Syrian extraction, of Maronite and Greek Orthodox Christian background. Louis Chedid's mother Andr\u00e9e (n\u00e9e Saab) was an Egyptian-born French writer and poet, who has written lyrics for Matthieu Chedid's songs. Matthieu Chedid's sisters are the music video and concert director \u00c9milie Chedid (born in 1970) and French singer Anna Chedid (born in 1987), also known by her stage name Nach. His brother Joseph \"Selim\" Chedid (born in 1986) is also a French singer and a guitar and drums player.\n\nChedid took an interest in music early on. In 1978, at the age of six, Chedid lent his voice to the chorus of his father's hit song T'as beau pas \u00eatre beau alongside older sister, \u00c9milie. During his teenage years and early twenties, Chedid was part of short-lasting groups such as Tam Tam, Les B\u00e9b\u00e9s fous and Les Poissons Rouges with Mathieu Boogaerts, as well as Julien Voulzy and Pierre Souchon (respectively the sons of singers Laurent Voulzy and Alain Souchon) who went on to form the duo Les Cherche Midi.\n\nHe has collaborated with a number of artists, both on stage and in the recording studio. Early into his solo career, Chedid was the opening act for Texas concerts. He has recorded with NTM, Sinclair, Billy Ze Kick, Brigitte Fontaine, Sean Lennon, Vanessa Paradis, and Johnny Hallyday.\n\nUntil 2008, Chedid was in a relationship with French actress Audrey Tautou.\n\nChedid performs and records under the stage name -M-. Chedid created -M- as means of overcoming his shyness on stage and also as a way of distancing his work from that of his father and grandmother. The pseudonym comes from Chedid's first initial but also refers to the similar-sounding French word aime, meaning love. The character -M- is a superhero, noted for having a playful nature, and recognized for his flamboyant costumes (primarily monochrome suits with slim trousers and long jackets with upward pointed collars) and hair styled into the shape of an M.\n\nIn 1997, -M- released his first solo album Le Bapt\u00eame. During this time; he played mainly solo or with the cellist Vincent S\u00e9gal. The album received overall positive critical reception, but public recognition only came a few months later, with the release of the single \"Machistador\". ...\n\nSource: Article \"Matthieu Chedid\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
