Soon afterwards, he started playing as an animator in Club Med alongside the Gigolo Brothers troop.\n\nIn 1990, he was hired by Ou\u00ef FM, the Paris Rock genre station where he met Olivier Baroux. The duet most known as Kad &amp; Olivier began working together and started their own show, the Rock'n Roll Circus,  introducing some of their most famous sketches (Pamela Rose, Teddy Porc  Fid\u00e8le...). The early success of the show allowed them to meet Jean-Luc Delarue who brought their act to TV.\n\nIn 1999, they began appearing on the French Satellite TV channel Com\u00e9die+ on their own show, La Grosse Emission. At the same time, Merad started his Cinema career with a lot of secondary roles.\n\nIn 2003, he scored his First box-office success with Mais Qui a tu\u00e9 Pamela Rose?, co-written with Baroux.\n\nIn 2007, Kad received the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Je vais Bien, ne t'en fais pas! and appears in AaRON's film soundtrack video clip. His best challenger was Dany Boon. During the shooting of Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis, this friendly struggle was a running joke between the two of them.\n\nThat same year, he made his first appearance with Les Enfoir\u00e9s music troop and is still one of its members. He was also inducted as the Godfather of the Telethon.\n\nThe next year, he starred as Phillipe Abrams in the French movie Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis.  The film was a surprise - and phenomenal - success in France and  Europe, becoming the best-attended movie ever made in France, with 21  million moviegoers.",
