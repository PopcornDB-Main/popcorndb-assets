        "biography": "Madeleine Robinson (born Madeleine Svoboda; 5 November 1917 \u2013 1 August 2004) was a French actress. She was born to a French mother and Czech father near Paris. She was orphaned at the age of 14, and worked to support herself and her two younger brothers, but enjoyed watching plays. She then studied under Charles Dullin. Her first lead role was in Forty Little Mothers (1936). During the Occupation of France, she had a prominent role in Love Story and Summer Light (both 1943), and The Bellman (1945). Because she had acted during the Occupation, Robinson found it difficult to get work afterwards, but again came to prominence in Une si jolie petite plage (1949). Madeleine Robinson won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress in 1959 for her role in \u00c0 double tour. In 2001, she was awarded a Moli\u00e8re d'honneur for her contribution to the field.\n\nSource: Article \"Madeleine Robinson\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
