He is probably best known for his role as the henpecked Kjeld in the Olsen Banden films.\n\nIn addition to having appeared in a large number of Danish films, Bundgaard starred in a number of operettas in the late 1940s until the 1950s, and worked at the Royal Danish Theatre as a singer between 1958 and 1973; however, he focused mostly on acting later on in his career, partly due to stage fright.\n\nHe died during the shooting of Olsen Bandens sidste stik and Tommy Kenter was used as stand-in for some of the scenes while Kurt Ravn did his voice.",
