She is probably best known for appearing alongside her husband Louis Del Grande in the television series Seeing Things, for which she earned a Gemini Award for Best Performance by a Lead Actress in a Continuing Role in a Comedy Series in 1986.\n\nShe was nominated in the same category for the same show in 1987, but lost to Dinah Christie.\n\nGibson also appeared in other notable roles in Black Christmas (1974), Outrageous! (1977) and Murder by Phone (1982), and television series such as King of Kensington (to which she also contributed as a writer), Katts and Dog and Sweating Bullets.",
