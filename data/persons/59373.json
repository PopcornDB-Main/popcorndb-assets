Born and raised on the ship, 1900 learned about the outside world through interactions with passengers, never setting foot on land, even for the love of his life. Years later, the ship may be destroyed, and a former band member fears that 1900 may still be aboard, willing to go down with the ship.",

They become companions in misfortune who will attempt to survive in a changing world. Pradelle, in his own way, does the same.",
