Page began his career as a studio\u00a0session musician\u00a0in London and, by the mid-1960s, he had become the most sought-after session guitarist in England. He was a member of\u00a0the Yardbirds\u00a0from 1966 to 1968. In late 1968, he founded Led Zeppelin. Page is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time. Rolling Stone\u00a0magazine has described Page as \"the pontiff of power riffing\" and ranked him number 3 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In 2010, he was ranked number two in\u00a0Gibson's list of \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\" and, in 2007, number four on\u00a0Classic Rock's \"100 Wildest Guitar Heroes\". He was inducted into the\u00a0Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u00a0twice; once as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin (1995). Page has been described by\u00a0Uncut\u00a0as \"rock's greatest and most mysterious guitar hero.\"\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0magazine voted Jimmy Page the 2nd Greatest Guitarist of all time.
