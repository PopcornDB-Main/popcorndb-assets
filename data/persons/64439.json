        "biography": "Fan Bingbing (Chinese: \u8303\u51b0\u51b0, born 16 September 1981 in Yantai) is a Chinese actress. From 2013 to 2017, she was included as the highest-paid celebrity in the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list after ranking in the top 10 every year since 2006. She appeared on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in 2017.\n\nFan's early work was in East Asian cinema and television, notably appearing in drama series My Fair Princess (1998\u20131999). Her breakthrough came with the film Cell Phone (2003) which was China's highest-grossing film of the year. She went on to star in several Chinese films, which include Lost in Beijing (2007), Buddha Mountain (2011) and Double Xposure (2012). For headlining the film I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016), Fan won the Silver Shell for Best Actress at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, as well as the Asian Film Award for Best Actress. Her foreign film roles include the French film Stretch (2011), the Korean film My Way (2011), the American superhero film X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) and the Hong Kong-Chinese-American film Skiptrace (2015).\n\nIn 2018, Fan disappeared for three months, reportedly during an investigation into her tax affairs by the Chinese authorities. She was reportedly fined a sum greater than her net worth. She subsequently appeared on social media, offering a public apology over tax evasion, for which she was fined more than CN\u00a5883 million (US$127 million).",
