Though they see his desperate efforts are breaking his health and his wife and daughter's hearts, they think only of getting the water.",

        "biography": "Pierre Nougaro (27 April 1904 in Toulouse - 26 October 1988 in Marseille) was a French operatic baritone, the father of the singer Claude Nougaro.\n\nAs a child, Nougaro enrolled in the evening classes of the Conservatoire de Toulouse at the instigation of his parents, who were themselves choristers. He obtained a first prize for singing.\n\nNougaro was director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Ledoux in Besan\u00e7on in the 1950s and then of the Rennes theatre in 1958.\n\nIn Rennes, Nougaro increased audiences by expanding the repertoire, including operettas in the season, and a world premiere every year. He also brought in the famous opera stars.\n\nIn 1967, he retired from the Rennes theatre (later called the Op\u00e9ra de Rennes).\n\nFrom the 1970s and for many years to come, his dramatic talent opened the door to a new career in television and film. He appeared in many TV movies, and in films directed by Claude Chabrol and Claude Berri among others.\n\nSource: Article \"Pierre Nougaro\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
