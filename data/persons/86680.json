        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nYuri Vladimirovich Nikulin\u00a0(Russian:\u00a0\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d; 18 December 1921 \u2013 21 August 1997) was a well-known Soviet\u00a0and\u00a0Russian\u00a0actor\u00a0and\u00a0clown\u00a0who starred in many popular films. He was awarded the title of\u00a0People's Artist of the USSR\u00a0in 1973 andHero of Socialist Labour\u00a0in 1990. He also received a number of state awards, including the prestigious\u00a0Order of Lenin, which he received twice in his lifetime.\n\nNikulin's effortless style and precise delivery, as well as his mastery of timing and his hilarious masks made him an outstanding comedian, arguably the best Russian comedian ever. Nikulin showed his range in a variety of genres from slapstick comedy to romance and war drama. His most popular film partners were\u00a0Georgiy Vitsin,\u00a0Yevgeni Morgunov,Natalya Varley,\u00a0Rolan Bykov,\u00a0Anatoli Papanov,\u00a0Sergei Filippov,\u00a0Mikhail Pugovkin,\u00a0Aleksandr Demyanenko,\u00a0Leonid Kuravlyov,\u00a0Andrey Mironov,\u00a0Evgeni Evstigneev,\u00a0Vasili Shukshin,\u00a0Vyacheslav Tikhonov,\u00a0Sergei Bondarchuk,\u00a0Nikolay Burlyaev,\u00a0Viktor Pavlov,\u00a0Boris Novikov\u00a0Vladimir Etush,\u00a0Saveli Kramarov,\u00a0Nikolai Grinko, and many other notable Russian actors. In the ring, Nikulin presented a phlegmatic temperament, slow and unsmiling, and to many in the West his personality was reminiscent of the great silent film comedian Buster Keaton. Rich in mimicry, doleful of expression, Nikulin was hailed as \u201ca brainy clown\u201d outside Russia. Simple in style and gentle with children, his only vestiges of make-up were a reddened nose and black lines around his eyes, much different from the grotesquely painted faces of Western clowns. Nikulin, affectionately called Uncle Yury by Russian children, relied mainly upon his wits to earn his place in history as one of the best clowns of the 20th century.",
