Rowling) Angelique Ala\u00efs published her  work under the initials of her first name or other pseudonyms. This was a  strategy in order to let it open whether the author was a man or a  woman. Best example: Harry Potter: The book should not appear under  Rowling's full name Joanne, because the publisher feared that boys would  not like to read books written by a woman. Rowling therefore decided to  use the initials \"J. K. \". Another feature that both writers have in  common: They write for feature films with fictional content in the area  of fantasy/ science fiction.",
