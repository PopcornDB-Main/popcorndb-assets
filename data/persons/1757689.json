        "biography": "Holly A. Morris is an Atlanta based actress and a Georgia native known for 'Stranger Things', 'Overcomer' and 'Nashville'. Her big break into the industry came early as she was cast as Winnie the Pooh in a camp production and crushed it which then fueled her desire to pursue acting throughout her formative school years. After seeing 'Broadcast News', she chose to major in Broadcast Journalism with a minor in Theater. Years later she would realize the glaring error in this decision; she didn't want to be a reporter, she wanted to be Holly Hunter. Expensive mistake, but thankfully her father, a commercial airline pilot who footed her college tuition, was the forgiving type. However, with no desire to follow the entertainment industry with a move to New York or LA, and not feeling called to the stage, she put her dream down after graduation and entered into real estate following in her mother and grandmother's footsteps. Fast forward decades later and the entertainment industry came to Atlanta. Over the past 10 years with an encouraging partner by her side, through divine encounters and fortunate connections, Holly has picked up her dream once again to see it become a reality in dozens of projects including commercials, television and film. She lives in Kennesaw, GA with her husband Tony, daughter Gracie Belle and two cats.",
