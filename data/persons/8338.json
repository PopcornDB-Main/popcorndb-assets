        "biography": "Jodelle Micah Ferland has built up an impressive resume filled with roles in film, television and, at the beginning of her career, commercials. Born on October 9, 1994, she got her start in an episode of CTV's Cold Squad (1998), before landing the lead role in her first film, Mermaid (2000) at an early age. Her portrayal of the heartbroken \"Desi\" earned her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination, making her the youngest nominee in history, as well as a Young Artist Award.\n\nSince then, she has appeared in films including They (2002), Trapped (2001) and Carrie (2002), and has made appearances on Smallville (2001), Dark Angel (2000) and The Collector (2004). She can also be seen starring in Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital (2004), playing a tortured young girl who haunts the hospital's halls. In 2004, she landed the lead role of \"Jeliza-Rose\" in Terry Gilliam's Tideland (2005), a film about a disturbed young girl who finds solace in her own imagination after the death of her parents. Several roles have followed, including taking on three characters in the horror, Silent Hill (2006), a despondent foster child in Hallmark's Pictures of Hollis Woods (2007), starring with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in Case 39 (2009), Matthew Broderick's dour daughter in Wonderful World (2009), and a surprise character in Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods (2011).
