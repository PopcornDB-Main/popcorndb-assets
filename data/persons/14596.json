He is an ethnic Bhutia and speaks Bhutia as his mother tongue.\n\nHe started his career by singing Indian and Nepali songs and acting in Indian and Nepali movies. His nepali song \"Kaanchi lai ghumaune Kathmandu Sahara\" is still famous among Nepali people after 2 decades. He has acted in numerous Hindi films such as Asoka and 16 December. He has also starred in some international projects, the most famous being Seven Years in Tibet where he acted alongside Hollywood actor Brad Pitt. In 2003, Denzongpa was awarded the Padma Shree, India's fourth highest civilian honour.
