        "biography": "Well-known and supported actor Joe Dorsey started acting in the early 70s, with The Mean Machine (1974). Though his acting career had just started, he got a great role which would also be his most remembered role as the greedy \"Parks Supervisor Kittridge\" in the 1976 box office hit Grizzly (1976). Dorsey got a great amount of profits with his second film. He then went on to supporting roles throughout the seventies in films like The Lincoln Conspiracy (1977), Wise Blood (1979) and The Prize Fighter (1979). His next remembered role was as \"Coach Spinks\" in The Great Santini (1979) and, by 1980, Dorsey was just getting better in Hopscotch (1980) and WarGames (1983). Dorsey occasionally took breaks from acting for golfing, going on a vacation and visiting family, until he was offered a role as a scientist in the science fiction box office smash with Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood in Brainstorm (1983). Dorsey was shocked when his new best friend (Wood) died during filming. Brainstorm (1983) and Grizzly (1976) were both Dorsey's greatest so far. He later did other films like Real Genius (1985), Club Paradise (1986), Stewardess School (1986), and the epic war drama Bat*21 (1988). As the 90s rolled, Dorsey was in Pet Sematary II (1992) and appeared uncredited in To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar (1995). He then worked with his relative Alexander Dorsey in Killing Midnight (1997) as \"Anthony Cambers\". Dorsey also has other relatives in films like actress Sandra Dorsey and his other relatives owned a music industry in the 50s. Dorsey also does Broadway plays. Actually lives in the coast of Colon, Republic of Panama",
