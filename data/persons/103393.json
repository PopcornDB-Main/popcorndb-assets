        "biography": "Jacques Becker (French: [b\u025bk\u025b\u0281]; 15 September 1906 \u2013 21 February 1960) was a French screenwriter and film director.\n\nBecker first worked in the 1930s as an assistant to director Jean Renoir during what is considered the latter's peak period, including such works as Partie de campagne (1936) and La Grande Illusion (1937). In the early part of World War II, Becker was held in a German prisoner-of-war camp for a year. During the Nazi occupation of France, he became a film director in his own right and he also joined the Comit\u00e9 de lib\u00e9ration du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais. He would go on to direct the period romance Casque d'or (1952), the influential gangster film Touchez pas au grisbi (1954), and the prison escape drama Le Trou (1959). While he remains lesser-known internationally than peers such as Marcel Carn\u00e9 and Renoir, Becker is nonetheless regarded as a major French filmmaker, with Casque d'or held in high esteem among film critics.\n\nBecker died at the age of 53 in 1960 and was interred in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse in Paris.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jacques Becker, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
