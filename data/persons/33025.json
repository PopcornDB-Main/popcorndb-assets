        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nHoward Charles Hickman (February 9, 1880 \u2013 December 31, 1949) was an American actor, director and writer. He was an accomplished stage leading man, who entered films through the auspices of producer Thomas H. Ince. Hickman directed 19 films and co-starred with his wife, actress Bessie Barriscale, in several productions before returning to the theatre.\n\nWith the rise of the sound film, Hickman returned to the film business but received mostly small roles, often as an authoritarian figure. Hickman made a brief appearance as plantation owner John Wilkes, father of Ashley Wilkes, in Gone with the Wind (1939). He ended his film career in 1944, after more than 270 films.\n\nHickman died of myocardial infarction in San Anselmo, California, and is buried at the Mount Tamalpais Cemetery, San Rafael, California.",
