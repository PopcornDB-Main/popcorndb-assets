        "biography": "Raoul Coutard (16 September 1924 \u2013 8 November 2016) was a French cinematographer. He is best known for his connection with the Nouvelle Vague period and particularly for his work with director Jean-Luc Godard. Coutard also shot films for New Wave director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut as well as Jacques Demy, a contemporary frequently associated with the movement.\n\nHe shot over 75 films during a career that lasted nearly half a century.\n\nCoutard originally planned to study chemistry, but switched to photography because of the cost of tuition. In 1945, Coutard was sent to participate in the French Indochina War; he lived in Vietnam for the next 11 years, working as a war photographer, eventually becoming a freelancer for Paris Match and Look. In 1956, he was approached to shoot a film by Pierre Schoendoerffer, La Passe du Diable. Coutard had never used a movie camera before, and reportedly agreed to the job because of a misunderstanding (he believed he was being hired to shoot production stills of the film).\n\nCoutard's first work collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard was Godard's first feature, \u00c0 bout de souffle, shot in 1959. He was reportedly \"imposed\" on Godard by producer Georges de Beauregard; the director had already settled on a different cinematographer.\n\nCoutard photographed nearly all of Godard's work in the Nouvelle Vague era (1959 - 1967), with the exception of Masculin, f\u00e9minin; their last work during this period was Week-end (1967), which marked the end of Godard's work as a 'mainstream' filmmaker. The two did not work together again until Passion; their final collaboration was Godard's next feature, Pr\u00e9nom Carmen. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Raoul Coutard\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
