Kurt attended AMDA and Graduated from Marymount Manhattan College with a BFA in Acting and a minor in directing.\n\nIn 1998 his Los Angeles stage directing debut was a critically acclaimed revival of \"Vampire Lesbians of Sodom\". The LA Times called Koehler's direction and production \"hilarious!\". In 2010 he revived \"Women Behind Bars\" in Hollywood where he earned the title of \"the Camp Specialist\".\n\nThe underground cult classic \"Chico's Angels\" is the brain child of Koehler and his collaborator Oscar Quintero. A Latino-Drag spoof of Charlie's Angels ran for eighteen years in the basement of a Mexican Restaurant in Silverlake to sold out houses. The success of Chico's Angels also produced short films, a web series and music videos.\n\nKoehler then collaborated with Julie Brown on the stage adaptations of \"Earth Girls are Easy\" and \"The Homecoming Queen Has Got A Gun.\"",
