After a few more extras casting calls and attending an acting workshop, the acting bug bit him.\n\nHe contacted Shari Rhodes, a local New Mexico and Texas casting director, for personal coaching in acting. Instead, she encouraged him to audition for a supporting role in the movie Urban Justice starring Steven Segal and Eddie Griffin. He was booked for the role, since then he has been on various movies and television series. He has had the privilege to work in such movies as Felon, Ring of Death, In Plain Sight, Terminator Salvation, Gamer, The Book of Eli, and Thor.\n\nJermaine continues to pursue an acting career with enthusiasm as well as opportunities to work in stunts.",
