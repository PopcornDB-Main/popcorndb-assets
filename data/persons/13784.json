Later he took roles that went against his initial \"tough guy\" image. In the late 1950s Lancaster abandoned his \"all-American\" image and came to be regarded as one of the best actors of his generation.\n\nLancaster was nominated four times for Academy Awards and won once \u2014 for his work in Elmer Gantry in 1960. He also won a Golden Globe for that performance and BAFTA Awards for The Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and Atlantic City (1980). His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was the most successful and innovative star-driven independent production company in Hollywood of the 1950s, making movies such as Marty (1955), Trapeze (1956), and Sweet Smell of Success (1957).\n\nLancaster also directed two films: The Kentuckian (1955) and The Midnight Man (1974).\n\nIn 1999, the American Film Institute named Lancaster nineteenth among the greatest male stars of all time.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Burt Lancaster, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
