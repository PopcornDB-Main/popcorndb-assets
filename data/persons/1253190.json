        "biography": "Bettina Kenney was born in the land of poets and thinkers, ancient forests, and fairy-tale castles - Germany. A childhood in England may account for her love of British television, her fondness for the smell of gas cookers, and her unapologetic use of the Oxford comma in whichever of her five working languages she happens to be writing. She trained as a competitive gymnast, dancer, singer, and musician before studying Performing Arts at the London Studio Centre. Known for her versatility across languages, genres, and formats, Bettina is not only an actor with a knack for accents and physically demanding roles, but also a highly sought-after voice actor with an extensive track record across animation, video games, and dubbing.",
