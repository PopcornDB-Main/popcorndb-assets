In 1992, he and several other popular Marvel illustrators left the company to found\u00a0Image Comics, which started a wave of comic books owned by their creators rather than by publishers. The first book published by Image Comics was Liefeld's\u00a0Youngblood\u00a0#1.\n\nLiefeld has been called one of the most controversial figures in the comic industry\u00a0for his drawing skills, business practices, and controversial comments.",
