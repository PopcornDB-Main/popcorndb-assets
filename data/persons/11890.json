Pedersen was never formally trained as an actor. He was approached by director Penelope Spheeris at a park in Burbank where the band T.S.O.L. was playing. According to Pedersen, who was unemployed at the time, \"I was thinking 'yeah, right' and didn't pay any attention to her until she said it paid $100 a day, which at the time was a lot of money. So I showed up for the audition on time and tried really hard not to screw it up. That was the start of my acting career.\" He played a punk rocker in Suburbia, and also appeared in Platoon, Night of the Comet and Point Break among others. (wikipedia)",
