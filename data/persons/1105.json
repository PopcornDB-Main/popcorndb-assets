        "biography": "William Marion \"Sonny\" Landham (February 11, 1941 \u2013 August 17, 2017), or Sonny Landham, was an American film actor, stunt man and politician. He portrayed tracker Billy Sole in Predator.\n\nAt the beginning of his acting career, Landham was an actor in pornographic films. He then became a mainstream movie actor and appeared in a number of Hollywood films, including The Warriors (as a subway policeman whose leg gets broken by a baseball bat-wielding Michael Beck), Predator, 48 Hrs., Lock Up and Action Jackson.\n\nIn 2003, Landham ran in the Republican Party primary election for the post of Governor of Kentucky, hoping to repeat the success of his Predator castmates Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He based his candidacy on opposition to an amendment which endorsed the Kentucky Family Court, saying his bad experiences at the hands of the family court had convinced him it was for the benefit of lawyers rather than families or children. He was unsuccessful in gaining the party's nomination. He ran briefly as an independent candidate, but withdrew on June 18, 2003, and endorsed the Republican slate.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
