He unsuccessfully sought office twice as a Democratic Party candidate, first in 1960 to the U.S. House of Representatives (for New York), and later in 1982 to the U.S. Senate (for California).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Gore Vidal, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
