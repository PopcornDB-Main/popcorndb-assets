She is best known for playing the title role in the 2013 film Ida, which was her film debut. For her role she was nominated for many festival and industry awards.\n\nIda director Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski was having trouble finding an actress to play his title character, so he put out word to the Warsaw film community to be on the lookout for talent. Trzebuchowska was spotted by a friend of Pawlikowski, sitting in a cafe reading a book. Trzebuchowska had no acting experience or plans to pursue an acting career, but agreed to meet with Pawlikowski because she was a fan of his 2004 film My Summer of Love.",
