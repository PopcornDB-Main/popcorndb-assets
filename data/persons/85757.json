        "biography": "Joseph Adam Jonas\u00a0(born August 15, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to fame as a member of the Jonas Brothers pop rock band, alongside his brothers\u00a0Kevin\u00a0and\u00a0Nick. The group released their debut studio album,\u00a0It's About Time, through the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0label in 2006. After signing with\u00a0Hollywood Records, the group released their\u00a0self-titled second studio album\u00a0in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the\u00a0Disney Channel\u00a0during this time, gaining a large following through the network: they appeared in the widely successful musical television film\u00a0Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel\u00a0Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010) as well as two of their series,\u00a0Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream\u00a0(2008\u20132010) and\u00a0Jonas (2009\u20132010).\n\nThe band's third studio album,\u00a0A Little Bit Longer (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single, \"Burnin' Up\", hit the top five on the\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Hot 100\u00a0chart. Their\u00a0fourth studio album, while still thriving on the\u00a0Billboard200\u00a0chart, saw a decline in record sales. After the group confirmed a hiatus, Joe released his debut solo studio album,\u00a0Fastlife\u00a0(2011), which saw moderate commercial success. After the Jonas Brothers officially parted ways due to creative differences, Jonas formed the\u00a0funk-pop\u00a0band\u00a0DNCE\u00a0in 2015, serving as the lead vocalist. The group saw the significant commercial success of their debut single, \"Cake by the Ocean\", which peaked at number 9 on the Billboard\u00a0Hot 100\u00a0chart in the United States.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Joe Jonas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
