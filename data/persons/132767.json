Born in Tokyo, Minamida made her screen debut in 1953 for the Daiei studio and quickly rose to stardom, working with Kenji Mizoguchi on two films: \u201cA Story from Chikamatsu\u201d and \u201cPrincess Yang Kwei-fei.\u201d  In 1955, she moved to the Nikkatsu studio, where she starred in Takumi Furukawa\u2019s \u201cSeason of the Sun\u201d (1956), a smash hit that launched the so-called \u201cSun Tribe\u201d boom for films about rebellious youth looking for sex and kicks on Shonan Beach \u2014 Japan\u2019s nearest equivalent to Malibu. Minamida acted in dozens of movies for Nikkatsu, working with Shohei Imamura, Seijun Suzuki, and other directors.  In 1961 she married her co-star on \u201cSeason of the Sun,\u201d Hiroyuki Nagato.
