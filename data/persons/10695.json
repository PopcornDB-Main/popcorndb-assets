When she was one year old, her parents separated, and she remained with her mother. In 1978, they moved to Bred\u00e4ng in Stockholm, Sweden, where Scorupco learned to speak Swedish, English and French.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Scorupco travelled throughout Europe working as a model, and appeared on the cover of Vogue. In 1987, she was discovered by director Staffan Hildebrand and starred in the film Ingen kan \u00e4lska som vi (\"Nobody can love like us\").  In the early 1990s, she had a brief but successful career as a pop singer, releasing the album IZA, which was certified gold in Sweden in 1991. On December 25, 1996, Scorupco married Polish ice hockey player Mariusz Czerkawski, then with the Edmonton Oilers. They had one daughter together, Julia (born September 15, 1997). They separated in 1998.\n\nOn January 30, 2003, Scorupco married an American, Jeffrey Raymond; they have a son, Jakob (born July 24, 2003), and now live in Los Angeles and New York City.\n\nIn 2011, Scorupco reprised her singing career, duetting with Swedish musician Peter J\u00f6back in his single Jag Har Dig Nu and featuring in the song's music video.
