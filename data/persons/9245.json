            "Nikola Piovani"
        ],
        "biography": "Nicola Piovani (born 26 May 1946) is an Italian light-classical musician, theater and film score composer. In 1998, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score for Roberto Benigni's film Life Is Beautiful (1997).\n\nAfter high school, Piovani enrolled at the Sapienza University of Rome, receiving his degree in piano from the Verdi Conservatory in Milan in 1967, and later studied orchestration under the Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis.\n\nIn 1971 and 1973 collaborated for the music of two albums of the songwriter Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9: Storia di un impiegato and Non al denaro non all'amore n\u00e9 al cielo. In 2008, after De Andr\u00e9 departure, Piovani wrote the music for the film Amore che vieni, amore che vai, inspired by a novel of De Andr\u00e9 himself, Un destino ridicolo.\n\nAmong his more popular works is the score for the Federico Fellini film Intervista, his second of three collaborations with the famous director, the others being Ginger e Fred (Ginger and Fred in English) and La voce della luna (The Voice of the Moon). Years later, he composed a ballet titled Balletto Fellini.\n\nIn 2000, his Academy Award-winning score for Life Is Beautiful (La Vita \u00e8 bella) was further nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media\" category, losing to Randy Newman. In 2005, he was a member of the jury at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. In light of his recent work with French directors, notably Dani\u00e8le Thompson, Philippe Lioret, and \u00c9ric-Emmanuel Schmitt, the French Minister of Culture gave him the title of Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres on 21 May 2008 at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTo date, Piovani has over 130 film scores to his credit, including films such as Slap the Monster on Page One (1972), The Perfume of the Lady in Black (1974), Flavia the Heretic (1974), Le Orme (1975), A Leap in the Dark (1980) The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982), and Kaos (1984). The music for the latter is considered by many as one of the best film scores ever done. However, he is reported to believe that \"Too many film scores make a composer a hack, but in the theatre music is above all craftsmanship\". Accordingly, he continues to work in musical theatre, and also composes concert and chamber music.\n\nPiovani also composed the first opera Amorosa presenza on a libretto by Aisha Cerami and Nicola Piovani, based on the novel by Vincenzo Cerami and is performed at the Teatro Verdi in Trieste in January 2022.\n\nIn 2023, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the World Soundtrack Academy.\n\nIn 2024, Piovani composed the score for Loris Lai's debut feature film, How Kids Roll.\n\nSource: Article \"Nicola Piovani\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
