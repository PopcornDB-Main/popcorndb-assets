        "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nGeorges Renavent (April 23, 1894 \u2013 January 2, 1969) was an American actor in film, Broadway plays and operator of American Grand Guignol. He was born in Paris, France.\n\nHis first American film appearance was in The Seven Sisters (1915). Fourteen years later he played an impressive starring role as the Kinkajou in the musical spectacular Rio Rita (1929). Renavent also starred in East of Borneo (1931), a film that went on to achieve latter-day fame when avant-garde filmmaker Joseph Cornell spliced together all of the leading lady's close-ups and came up with a surrealistic exercise titled Rose Hobart (1936). Renavent's final film, Mara Maru, was made in 1952.",
