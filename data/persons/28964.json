M\u00e9li\u00e8s's first wife Eugenie died in May 1913, and in 1925 he married d'Alcy. Her concession of a toy stall at the Gare Montparnasse, Paris, manned by Georges, provided their only income for several years. In 1932 they moved into an apartment at a home for cinema veterans. After M\u00e9li\u00e8s's death, d'Alcy appeared in the poignant framing sequences of Georges Franju's short dramatisation of his life, Le Grand M\u00e9li\u00e8s (1952), with M\u00e9li\u00e8s's son Andr\u00e9 playing his father. Jehanne d'Alcy died on 14 October 1956 at Versailles, aged ninety-two.",
