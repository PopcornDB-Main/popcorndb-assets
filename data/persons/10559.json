This title was not due to my brilliance but rather because most of the plays I was in closed after a run of anywhere from one night to two weeks. I would then move immediately into another.\"\n\nDewhurst was a renowned interpreter of the works of Eugene O\u2019Neill on the stage, and her career also encompassed film, early dramas on live television, and Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Colleen Dewhurst, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
