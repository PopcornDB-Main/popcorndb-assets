        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nEdwin Eugene Lockhart (July 18, 1891 \u2013 March 31, 1957) was a Canadian-American character actor, singer, and playwright. He also wrote the lyrics to a number of popular songs. He became a United States citizen in 1939.\n\nBorn in London, Ontario, the son of John Coats Lockhart and Ellen Mary (n\u00e9e Delaney) Lockhart, he made his professional debut at the age of six when he appeared with the Kilties Band of Canada. He later appeared in sketches with Beatrice Lillie.\n\nLockhart is mostly remembered for his film work. He made his film debut in the 1922 version of Smilin' Through, as the Rector, but did not make his sound debut until 1934 in the film By Your Leave, where he played the playboy Skeets. Lockhart subsequently appeared in more than 300 motion pictures. He often played villains, including a role as the treacherous informant Regis in Algiers, the American remake of Pepe le Moko, which gained him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He also played the suspicious Georges de la Tr\u00e9mouille, the Dauphin's chief counselor, in the famous 1948 film Joan of Arc, starring Ingrid Bergman. He had a great succession of \"good guy\" supporting roles including Bob Cratchit in A Christmas Carol (1938) and the judge in Miracle on 34th Street (1947).",
