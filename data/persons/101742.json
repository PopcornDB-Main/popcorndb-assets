        "biography": "From Wikipedia\n\nLeonard Mudie (11 April 1883\u201314 April 1965) was an English character actor whose career lasted for nearly fifty years. After a successful start as a stage actor in England, he appeared regularly in the US, and made his home there from 1932. He appeared in character roles on Broadway and in Hollywood films.\n\nMudie made his film debut in a Boris Karloff film, The Mummy, in 1932. He moved to Hollywood in that year and lived there for the rest of his life. He played a range of screen parts, some substantial, and others short cameos. Among the bigger roles were Dr. Pearson in The Mummy, Porthinos in Cleopatra (1934), Maitland in Mary of Scotland (1936), and De Bourenne in Anthony Adverse (1936). His small roles, according to The New York Times, were typically \"a bewigged, gimlet-eyed British judge\".\n\nMudie made the post-war transition into television, and appeared in several episodes of Adventures of Superman. For the post-war cinema he played the regular character Commander Barnes in the series of Bomba, the Jungle Boy films.",
