His motion picture acting career in Europe spanned a period of 51 years.\n\nIn 1941/1942 he studied acting at the \u201cConservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur d`Art Dramatique\u201d in Paris. Until 1944 he had different engagements at theatres in Paris, e. g. \u201cTheatre Pigalle\u201d, \u201cSalle Pleyel\u201d, \u201cTheatre des Ambassadeurs\u201d. From 1944 to 1946 he was called up for military service in the French Army in Indochina shortly before the First Indochina War took place there. He caught malaria during that time and, in consequence of the disease, was left hard of hearing. From 1947 to 1948 he had different engagements at theatres and touring companies not only in France, but also in the French part of Allied-occupied Germany and in Florence, e. g. \u201cTourn\u00e9e Spectacles Moyses\u201d, Teatro della Pergola. He acted, inter alia, under the direction of Georges Douking. His first film role came at age 25 in Ruy Blas (1948).\n\nPaul Muller appeared in over 230 films since his first role in 1948.
