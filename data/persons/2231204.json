The sixties in a small village in Valencia, the eighties in Madrid, the present, when he feels an immeasurable emptiness, facing his mortality, the incapability of continuing filming, the impossibility of separating creation from his own life. The need of narrating his past can be his salvation.",

        "biography": "\u201cI was 12 years old when I set foot on a stage for the very first time,\u201d Spanish actor C\u00e9sar Vicente says. \u201cIt was the year-end dance at my school. I realized [then] that performing would be part of my life; it allowed me to be confident in a way that I wasn\u2019t before.\u201d Chasing that sense of invincibility, Vicente enrolled in the dramatic arts program at Sevilla\u2019s Viento Sur Teatro. Following four years of intensive training there, he soon began landing parts. These included the role of El\u00edas, a clever groundskeeper at an all-girls finishing school, in the 2018 series A Different View, and a young Hern\u00e1n Cortez, the Spanish imperialist who defeated the Aztecs, in the 2019 historical drama series Hern\u00e1n.\n\nThough each of those characters played a role in Vicente\u2019s development, it was his role as Eduardo, a local laborer learning to read and write, in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s 2019 film Pain and Glory, that put him on the global map. \u201cMy experience as Eduardo was the most wonderful time of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an opportunity to develop my hidden potential and to put into practice the skills I had learned in the Academy.\u201d\n\nEduardo is an ancillary but potent figure in the life of Salvador Mallo\u2014the film\u2019s protagonist and a loose analog for its director. In building the character, Vicente met with Almod\u00f3var on multiple occasions. \u201c[Almod\u00f3var] described the character meticulously to get the most out of my abilities,\u201d Vicente says. \u201cIt [was] an honor to play this important role in the director\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nVicente\u2019s mission is not only to be a conduit to a filmmaker\u2019s vision, but also to prove his craft. \u201cI am always trying to learn from the mistakes I make. Even if I keep failing, I never give up,\u201d he says. For instance, his next red carpet will likely be a smoother affair than that of the Pain and Glory premiere: \u201cThat was a challenge,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAll the recognition and promotion was fun but very intense for me.\u201d If his parting sentiment is any indication, Vicente is ready to savor the spotlight that awaits him: \u201cI feel a burning desire to conquer the world.\u201d",
