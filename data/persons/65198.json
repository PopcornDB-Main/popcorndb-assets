He first gained recognition in Japan for his starring role as Jiraiya (Ninja Black) in Ninja Sentai Kakuranger, being the second American-born sentai senshi. He has appeared in over 30 films and television series, including the video game adaptations DOA: Dead or Alive and Street Fighter Alpha. He competed on five seasons of the obstacle challenge program Sasuke, where he was the first American competitor.\n\nLike his father, Kosugi has appeared in both Japanese and American media. In Japan, Kane is considered gaijin tarento (foreign talent) due to his Nisei (second generation) foreign born heritage.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kane Kosugi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
