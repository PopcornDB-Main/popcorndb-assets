He was born and raised in New York City and studied fine art at CalArts in Los Angeles, with a focus on sculpture and large-scale installation artworks. After graduating, Chinlund returned to New York and started his career in film, first as a carpenter, before finding opportunities as a production designer on music videos and independent films.

After a short break from features to help care for his young daughter, Chinlund returned to the feature world in 2012 to work on The Avengers for Marvel, which set a record for the highest-grossing opening weekend ever. Since then he has been nominated six times for Art Directors Guild Awards. Two for his work on the Fox films Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes, directed by Matt Reeves, and most recently for his work on The Lion King, directed\u00a0by Jon Favreau, which was the first feature film ever shot entirely in virtual reality. Over the years, James has been active in the commercial and fashion worlds as well. Collaborators include Inez\u00a0van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, Rupert Sanders, Spike Jonze, Marc Forster, Lance Acord, Gus Van Sant, and Harmony Korine.
