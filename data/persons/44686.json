He is best known for his role as Manolito \"Mano\" Montoya on the 1960s television series The High Chaparral and as the corrupt and vengeful Trooper Hancock in The Hitcher.\n\nDarrow's starring role in the play The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit brought him to the attention of television producer David Dortort, who cast him as Manolito Montoya on the western series The High Chaparral, which aired for four seasons on NBC from 1967 to 1971. The series made Darrow and the series' lead, Cameron Mitchell, household names.
