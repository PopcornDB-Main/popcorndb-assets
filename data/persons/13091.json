        "biography": "Presley Chweneyagae (October 19, 1984 \u2014 May 27, 2025) was a South African actor best known for his breakthrough lead role in Tsotsi (2005).\n\nChweneyagae went into acting at an early age, taking acting classes from the age of 10. His first major role proved to be a history-making one, securing the part of David, aka Tsotsi, in Gavin Hood\u2019s searing 2005 crime drama Tsotsi. In the film, set in a Johannesburg township, Chweneyagae plays a small-time hoodlum who steals a car, only to discover a baby in the back seat that causes him to change his ways.\n\nTsotsi was a huge hit with critics, with praise especially for Chweneyagae\u2019s performance. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for best foreign language film, becoming the first South African film to win an Oscar. The success of Tsotsi secured Chweneyagae's place as one of the best known South African actors.\n\nAs well as features, Chweneyagae\u2019s found great success on domestic television, and was arguably better known in South Africa for his lead role in the popular telenovela The River (2028\u201324). In the Pretoria-set show, which takes place in the diamond mining industry, Chweneyagae\u2019s scheming, villainous and charismatic Thuso \u2018Cobra\u2019 Mokoena became a fan favorite, and he received his own spin-off series, Cobrizi. The River won Chweneyagae a South African Film and Television Award in 2019, and helped Chweneyagae become a streaming star outside South Africa as the series became popular in other parts of Africa.\n\nAs well as film and TV, Chweneyagae was deeply involved in theater, boasting extensive credits and starring in several Shakespeare productions. Chweneyagae also wrote and directed plays. He co-wrote, with Paul Grootboom, the acclaimed stage play Relativity and directed the award-winning production CELL NO 4.\n\nChweneyagae died from natural causes on May 27, 2025, at the age of 40.",
