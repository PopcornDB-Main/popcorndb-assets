Tesfaye explored new wave and dream pop with his critically-acclaimed fourth studio album After Hours (2020), which featured the chart record-setting single \"Blinding Lights\" and the US number-one singles \"Heartless\" and \"Save Your Tears\". Dance-pop inspired his fifth album Dawn FM (2022), which included the US top-ten single \"Take My Breath\".\n\nTesfaye is a cinephile, and has made numerous movie references in his music videos and teasers.
