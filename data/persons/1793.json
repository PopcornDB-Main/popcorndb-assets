He had a career spanning seven decades (motion pictures from 1943 to 2006) across radio, television, theatre, and film.  During the mid-1970s, Montalb\u00e1n was most notable as the spokesman in automobile advertisements for the Chrysler Cordoba, in which he famously extolled the \"soft Corinthian leather\" used for its interior. He also advertised the Chrysler New Yorker. From 1977 to 1984, he became famous as Mr. Roarke the main star in the television series Fantasy Island. He played Khan Noonien Singh in both the 1967 episode \"Space Seed\" of the first season of the original Star Trek series, and the 1982 film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. He won an Emmy Award in 1978 for his role in the mini series How the West Was Won and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 1993. Into his 80s, he continued to perform, often providing voices for animated films and commercials, and appearing in several Spy Kids films as Grandfather Valentin.",
