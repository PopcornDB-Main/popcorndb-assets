She is unable to return the key on time, but it is revealed that the Beast is the genuinely handsome one. A simple tale of tragic love that turns into a surreal vision of death, desire, and beauty.",

        "biography": "Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment (March 18, 1913, Bordeaux \u2013 March 17, 1996, Monte Carlo, Monaco) was a French film director and screenwriter. Cl\u00e9ment studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he developed an interest in filmmaking. In 1936, he directed his first film, a 20 minute short written and featuring Jacques Tati. Cl\u00e9ment spent the latter part of the 1930s making documentaries in parts of the Middle East and Africa. In 1937, he and archaeologist Jules Barthou were in Yemen making preparations to film a documentary, the first ever of that country and one that includes the only known film image of Imam Yahya. Almost ten years passed before Cl\u00e9ment directed a feature but his French Resistance film, La Bataille du rail (1945), gained much critical and commercial success. From there Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment became one of his country's most successful and respected directors, garnering numerous awards including two films that won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the first in 1950 for The Walls of Malapaga (Au-del\u00e0 des grilles) and the second time two years later for Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits). Cl\u00e9ment had international success with several films but his star-studded 1966 epic Is Paris Burning?, written by Gore Vidal and Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Paul Graetz was a costly box office failure. Cl\u00e9ment continued to make a few films until his retirement in 1975, including an international success with Rider On The Rain that starred Charles Bronson and Marl\u00e8ne Jobert. In 1984 the French motion picture industry honored his lifetime contribution to film with a special C\u00e9sar Award. Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment died in 1996 and was buried in the local cemetery in Menton on the French Riviera where he had spent his years in retirement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
