As a result of her marriage to Gene Roddenberry and her ongoing relationship with Star Trek \u2013 participating in some way in every series to date \u2013 she was sometimes referred to as \"the First Lady of Star Trek\". She and Gene Roddenberry were married in Japan on August 6, 1969, after the cancellation of the Star Trek: The Original Series. They had one son together, Eugene \"Rod\" Roddenberry, Jr., born in 1974.",
