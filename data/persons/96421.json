        "biography": "Kathleen Harrison was long a stalwart of British cinema.\u00a0Her place was always firmly below stairs \u2013 a cook perhaps, or a cleaning lady often answering the door with a puzzled expression always fearful that trouble was just around the corner.\n\nShe was born in 1892 in Blackburn in Lancashire.\u00a0She studied at RADA and then went to live in Agentina for some time. On her return to Britain, she made her stage debut in 1926 in \u201cThe Constant Flirt\u201d. Her first major film role was in 1931 in \u201cHobson\u2019s Choice\u201d.\u00a0Kathleen Harrison made one film in Hollywood in Emlyn Williams \u201cNight Must Fall\u201d in 1937 as a maid (naturally).\u00a0She achieved national fame as Mrs Huggett in four films about the Huggett family. In the mid 1960\u2032s she starred in a very popular television series Mrs Thursday about a cleaner who won the football pools.\u00a0She died in 1995 at the age of 103.",
