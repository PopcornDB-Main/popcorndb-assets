She was also cast as Sasha in First Girl I Loved, starring opposite Dylan Gelula and Mateo Arias. She is also known as Elodie Davis in the show Trinkets on Netflix. In July 2017, Hildebrand was added to the main cast for season two of The Exorcist.\n\nHildebrand was born in College Station, Texas. Regarding her sexuality, Hildebrand has said, \"I learned pretty early on that I like both boys and girl. I am lucky to say now that it is not frightening for me living in LA to be gay. Even when I was in Texas, I wasn\u2019t afraid. I was kind of out in high school. I just could never decide on what label. I am glad that I am public about it and I think I should be.\"",
