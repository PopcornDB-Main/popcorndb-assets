        "biography": "Benjamin Franklin McGrath (February 2, 1903 \u2013 May 13, 1967) was an American television and film actor and stunt performer who played the comical, optimistic cook with the white beard, Charlie B. Wooster, on the western series Wagon Train for five seasons on NBC and then three seasons on ABC. McGrath appeared in all 272 episodes in the eight seasons of the series, which had ended its run only two years before his death. McGrath's Wooster character hence provided the meals and companionship for both fictional trail masters, Ward Bond as Seth Adams and John McIntire as Christopher \"Chris\" Hale.\n\nMcGrath was born in Mound City in Holt County in far northwestern Missouri.\n\nMcGrath married Libby Quay Buschlen (1902\u20131978), a native of Ontario, Canada. He died May 13, 1967 at the age of sixty-four of a heart attack in Beverly Hills, California, and was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.
