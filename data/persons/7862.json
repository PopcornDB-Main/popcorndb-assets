        "biography": "Floyd Red Crow Westerman (August 17, 1936 \u2013 December 13, 2007) was a Dakota Sioux musician, political activist, and actor. He was known for years as a renaissance man, for his many talents, dedication and passion. A member of the Dakota (Sioux) nation, he was an accomplished actor on the big and small screen for over 20 years, a political advocate for indigenous and environmental causes worldwide and a popular singer/songwriter, performing with such stars as Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley and Kris Kristofferson to name just a few.\n\nRed Crow\u2019s last endeavor again merged his own life experiences with his distinctive brand of artistry. With his most recent series of bronze sculptures, he beautifully recreated the most sacred spiritual Lakota/Dakota \u201cSacred Pipe,\u201d as well as busts of the greatest, most influential leaders in Native American history. Legendary heroes Sitting Bull, Geronimo and Chief Joseph, who led their nations against persecution and the devastating invasion of their land in the mid-19th century, compose an ideal triumvirate on which part of this collectible art is based.\n\nThe pieces were personally sculpted by Red Crow in an impressionistic medium before being bronzed to create a fine patina glow. Upon completion, they were autographed by Red Crow, and given an official authentication number. The busts of the famous Native American leaders, which stand approximately 1-1/2 feet high, were handcrafted to match the pose of a corresponding historical photograph. One noteworthy characteristic of these busts is the leaders\u2019 eyes, to which Floyd gave particular attention, because in his words, \u201cThe eyes are key to the spirit of each of these men. \u201cPlus, they are of course, the window to their soul.\u201d",
