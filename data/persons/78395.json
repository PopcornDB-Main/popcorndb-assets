        "biography": "When Norman Howell was fourteen years old his rodeo career landed him an acting part in the 1971 film The Cowboys. He was taught how to throw his first movie punch by the legendary John Wayne, who along with Yakima Canutt, were the innovators of the modern movie fight. This planted the seed that Norman may prefer stunt work over acting roles. Soon after, his career took off. He doubled John Travolta, Richard Chamberlain, Peter O'Toole, Bruce Willis, Mark Harmon, Dirk Benedict, and was Roger Moore's stunt-double in 007. Norman's stunt coordinator career started with Footloose and then Kevin Costner gave this nominee his first big break as a stunt coordinator on Dances with Wolves and as 2nd unit director in The Bodyguard, Open Range and Mr. Brooks. Norman Howell's professionalism, creativity and execution has earned him a place among the top stunt coordinators and second unit directors in the industry.",
