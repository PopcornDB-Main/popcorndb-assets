Cosgrove's film debut came in 2003, when she appeared as Summer Hathaway in School of Rock. She appeared in a number of minor television roles over several years before coming to prominence as Megan Parker on the Nickelodeon television series Drake & Josh. In 2007, she landed the role of Carly Shay, the lead character on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom iCarly, on which she starred until 2012.\n\nAs of May 2010, Cosgrove earned $180,000 per episode of iCarly, making her the second-highest-paid child star on television, and in 2012 was listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest paid child actress. Cosgrove also voiced Margo in the animated film Despicable Me (2010) and its 2013 sequel. That year, Cosgrove was cast in an NBC television pilot titled Girlfriend in a Coma, which didn't materialize after Christina Ricci left the production. In 2016, she starred on the short-lived NBC sitcom Crowded.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Miranda Cosgrove, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
