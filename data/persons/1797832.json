He began training in martial arts at 16, focusing on Taekwondo, where he developed the remarkable vertical jump that would become one of his signature strengths. He went on to teach Taekwondo for over a decade.\n\nAt 19, Cali expanded his movement repertoire by exploring street dance styles such as body popping, locking, and breakdancing. However, in 2006, a knee injury ended his competitive Taekwondo career.\n\nIn 2007, he relocated to London and discovered a passion for parkour. His unique fusion of freerunning and dance quickly caught the attention of directors and choreographers, leading to roles in short films, commercials, and music videos. He competed in the 2008 Barclaycard World Freerun Championships, where his performance stood out for its heavy incorporation of dance. The following year, he served as a judge for the competition.\n\nLater in 2009, Cali and several friends departed from Urban Freeflow to form their team,\u00a0Storm Freerun, which became known for pushing the boundaries of movement artistry.\n\nCombining martial arts, parkour, freerunning, acrobatics, and performance, Cali naturally transitioned into stunt work.",
