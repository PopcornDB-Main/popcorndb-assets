He's best known for his roles of Steven Hyde on That '70s Show (1998\u20132006), Milo Foster on Men at Work (2012\u20132014) and Jameson \"Rooster\" Bennett on The Ranch (2016\u20132018). He married actress Bijou Phillips in 2011 and separated in 2023.\n\nIn May 2023, Masterson was convicted of raping two women in 2003. A third count of rape resulted in a\u00a0hung jury. In September 2023, he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. He is a\u00a0Scientologist, as were his victims at the time of the assaults. The Church of Scientology's attempts to silence the victims, and its subsequent interference, resulted in a 20-year delay in bringing the crimes to justice.",
