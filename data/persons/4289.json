        "biography": "Pierre Vaneck (born Pierre Auguste Van Hecke; 15 April 1931 \u2013 31 January 2010) was a French actor. During his career, he won a Moli\u00e8re Award in 1988 and received a C\u00e9sar Award nomination in 2009.\n\nSon of a Belgian army officer, Pierre Vaneck spent his youth in Antwerp, Belgium, until the age of 17, when he started medical studies in Paris, France. Before long, he branched into studying acting, first at the Rene Simon school, and then at the Theatre Academy, under Henri Rollan. He earned his living meanwhile by working for a saddle-maker by day, and in the evenings, he recited Fran\u00e7ois Villon's poems in cabarets. His d\u00e9but on the stage came in 1952 in The Three Musketeers in the role of Louis XIII. His first important role in the cinema was in the Julien Duvivier film, Marianne of my Youth in 1955.\n\nPierre Vaneck was primarily a theatre and television actor. The general public knew him particularly for his television role as the father of the main character in Fabien Cosma, as well as in many other serials (Spring Tides, The Garonne...). Vaneck died on Sunday 31 January 2010, during open-heart surgery. He was married to Sophie Becker, daughter and sister of Jacques Becker and Jean Becker. His grandchildren, Aur\u00e9lie and Thibaud Vaneck, are both actors, and feature in the television series Plus Belle la Vie which is broadcast on France 3 channel.\n\nSource: Article \"Pierre Vaneck\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
