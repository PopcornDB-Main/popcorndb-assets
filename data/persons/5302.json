        "biography": "GERRY  VICHI  began his acting career while teaching English and Drama at Holliston High back home in Holliston, Mass.  He began doing doing summer stock and local dinner theatre shows all over New England and met Jack Hallett at the Town and Country Playhouse in Salem, New Hampshire in 1971.  He eventually earned his Actor\u2019s Equity card at the American Stage Festival in Milford, New Hampshire. After much talk of becoming an actor full time, Jack Hallett called him in 1973 from the Village Dinner Theatre in Raleigh, NC and offered him the lead in \u201cTunnel of Love\u201d opposite film actress Margaret O\u2019Brien.  Gerry resigned from his teaching job of 15 years, flew the next morning to North Carolina, and never looked back.  He stayed on in Raleigh to play opposite Dan Dailey in \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d and headed straight to New York City after. He was immediately hired for his first Broadway show,  Kander and Ebb\u2019s \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d starring Lauren Bacall and Harry Guardino.  It was deliriously fun for two years in the 1970\u2019s to be in a hit Broadway show.  Other Broadway shows followed and he played \u201cMoonface Martin\u201d in \u201cAnything Goes\u201d at Lincoln Center starring Patti LuPone,  the short lived, \u201cAin\u2019t Broadway Grand\u201d, the Wizard in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, Fezziwig in the musical version of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d,  and  \u201cHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\u201d with Matthew Broderick.  He appeared in a string of shows of the popular Encore series such as \u201cDo Re Mi\u201d, \u201dFollies\u201d, and \u201c70, Girls, 70\u201d, another Kander and Ebb gem.  He returned to Broadway in \u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone\u201d and when that closed, he began rehearsals the next morning for yet another Kander and Ebb hit, \u201cCurtains\u201d starring David Hyde Pierce. Gerry also worked Off-Broadway with Al Pacino in Brecht\u2019s, \u201cIn the Jungle of the Cities\u201d and Bill Irwin in \u201cScapin\u201d.  His film credits include, \u201cComa\u201d, \u201cKing of the Gypsies\u201d, \u201cVibes\u201d, \u201cCity Hall\u201d(again with Al Pacino), \u201cFind Me Guilty\u201d, \u201cJust My Luck\u201d(w/Lindsay Lohan), and the role of Herman Gluck in Spike Lee\u2019s wonderful drama, \u201cInside Man\u201d starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, to date, his most gratifying cinematic experience.  After \u201cCurtains\u201d closes, Gerry is scheduled to star in a new musical, \u201cMinsky\u2019s\u201d,\n\nbased on the grand old days of burlesque.  \u201c\u201cMinsky\u2019s\u201d was written by Bob Martin(\u201cDrowsy Chaperone\u201d) and Charles Strouse(\u201cAnnie\u201d, \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d)\n\nand  Casey Nicolaw will direct. The phone call from Jack Hallett in 1973 changed his life so he\u2019s had a lifetime habit of returning all Jack\u2019s calls immediately!!  He looks forward to working at the brand new Bayberry Dinner Playhouse.  Gerry Vichi is an Actor known for Find Me Guilty (2006), Sex and the City 2 (2010) and Man on a Ledge (2012).",
