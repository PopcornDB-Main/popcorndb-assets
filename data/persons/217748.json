        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRuth Clifford (February 17, 1900 \u2013 November 30, 1998) was an American actress of leading roles in silent films, whose career lasted from silent days into the television era.  Clifford got work as an extra and began her career at 15 at Universal, in fairly substantial roles. She received her first film credit for her work in Behind the Lines (1916).\n\nBy her mid-twenties, she was playing leads and second leads, including the role of Abraham Lincoln's lost love, Ann Rutledge, in The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln (1924). But sound pictures found her roles diminishing, and throughout the next three decades she played smaller and smaller parts.\n\nShe was a favorite of director John Ford (they played bridge together), who used her in eight films, but rarely in substantial roles. She was also, for a time, the voice of Walt Disney's Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck.\n\nClifford's obituary in the Los Angeles Times noted that she \"became a prime source for historians of the silent screen era\".",
