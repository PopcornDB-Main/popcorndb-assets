        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  Willoughby Gray\u00a0(5 November 1916 \u2013 13 February 1993) was an English actor of stage and screen born in London. (Though several sources suggest he was born in\u00a0Aberdeen,\u00a0Scotland). He was the stepson of\u00a0Henry Pownall, as his father, Captain John Gray, was killed in Iraq close to the time of his birth.  John Willoughby Gray served with distinction during the\u00a0Second World War\u00a0with\u00a0GHQ Liaison Regiment\u00a0(Phantom). For most of the campaign in Europe he commanded a patrol with\u00a011th Armoured Division. For his gallant and distinguished services in the North West Europe campaign, he was appointed MBE. His recommendation reads:  \"Captain Gray has commanded a divisional patrol with outstanding success throughout the campaign. The resource and initiative shown by him at all times has resulted in a great deal of vital information reaching Army and Corps HQ much more quickly than would otherwise have been the case, In addition, he has shown great enterprise and complete disregard for his own personal safety on many occasions, notably whilst carrying out reconnaissances in the\u00a0Antwerp\u00a0area during the advance through\u00a0Belgium. The bearing of this officer under arduous conditions and his cheerfulness and willingness to do any work delegated to him unhesitatingly have been an example to those with whom he came in contact.\"  He achieved popularity in the mid-1950s after making 38 appearances on the television series\u00a0The Adventures of Robin Hood. He appeared as 'Pete' in\u00a0Harold Pinter's\u00a0The Birthday Party\u00a0on its very first run in 1958, this being just one of countless stage performances he made. Though over-shadowed by his stage career, Gray made a handful of incredibly popular films, notably as a priest in\u00a0Laurence Olivier's film\u00a0Richard III\u00a0(1955),\u00a0The Mummy\u00a0(1959),\u00a0Absolution\u00a0(1978),\u00a0The Hit(1984), the\u00a0James Bond\u00a0film\u00a0A View to a Kill\u00a0(1985) as retired\u00a0Nazi\u00a0doctor and\u00a0Max Zorin\u00a0(Christopher Walken) henchman Karl Mortner/Hans Glaub,[1]\u00a0and as the elderly and kind king in\u00a0The Princess Bride\u00a0(1987).  In the late 1980s, he appeared in the\u00a0BBC\u00a0drama\u00a0Howards' Way\u00a0as banker Sir John Stevens.  In\u00a0Sergei Bondarchuk's 1970 film\u00a0Waterloo, he is credited as both an actor (playing Captain Ramsey) and a military consultant.[2]  Gray died aged 76 in February 1993. His wife, who wrote as Felicity Gray,(Nee Margaret Andraea) was a choreographer, speaker and writer on ballet, who notably taught\u00a0Gene Tierney\u00a0for her role in\u00a0Never Let Me Go.
