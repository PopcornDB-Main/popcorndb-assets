        "biography": "After more than six years of the corporate grind in New York, Dallas, San Francisco and Chicago, Chase came to the realization that there was more to life than Hi-Tech companies and start-up businesses. Like many others who come to Hollywood everyday with stars in their eyes, Chase had aspirations of becoming a professional actor. The Los Angeles native didn't have far to go, geographically speaking. He knew he would be giving up his financial stability and would probably have to wait on a few tables to reach his dream, but had little doubt it would all be worth it at the end of the day. Needing to clear his head, Chase traveled to Barcelona, Spain before returning to LA to pursue acting full-time. Although born in LA, he was raised all over the world in locations including South Korea, Panama and Peru. Chase graduated in 1997 with a BA degree in History and Political Science from UC San Diego and is a huge fan of the LA Dodgers.",
