He appeared in 82 films between 1923 and 1939.\n\nIn 1929 he starred in Piccadilly opposite Anna May Wong. At the time, Piccadilly was not well received, but has since been recognised as one of the best films of the late British silent era.\n\nThomas moved to Hollywood, where he appeared in minor roles in various films until his death. He played \"King\" Westley, the fortune-hunting husband/fianc\u00e9 of Claudette Colbert, in Frank Capra's comedy It Happened One Night.",
