In the movie, the songs \"Shama Lama Ding Dong\" and \"Shout\" were sung by Lloyd G. Williams and lip-synched by Jessie.\n\nIn the 1980s, Jessie purchased the rights to the band name Otis Day and The Knights from Universal Studios and formed a real-life version of the band with some members of his family and toured the country for years afterward, with Jessie assuming the identity of Otis Day. The group released a concert video, Otis My Man, in 1987 and recorded an album, produced by George Clinton, that came out in 1989 titled Shout which flopped. It included updated versions of \"Shout\" and \"Shama Lama Ding Dong\" sung by Jessie.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
