Most recently, she was a consultant and actor for Anora, the Palme d\u2019Or recipient for the 77th Festival de Cannes and Academy Award Winner for Best Picture. Her multidisciplinary approach utilizes poetry, movement, photography, and film to express the art of storytelling. In her visual repertoire, Carnabuci seeks to capture emotion and lived experiences. Through dance, her goal is to alchemize the internal with the external, dropping into states of flow and creating moods in which her onlookers have the ability to participate. She is most excited to challenge, entertain, and offer space for dialogue.",
