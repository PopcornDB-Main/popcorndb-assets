Towards the end of his career he also appeared in cameo roles in several Hammer horror films, with a fairly large role in The Brides of Dracula as the hypochondriac and fee-hungry local doctor.  Malleson was also a writer on many films, including some of those in which he had small parts, such as Nell Gwyn (1934) and The Thief of Bagdad (1940). He also translated and adapted several of Moli\u00e8re's plays (The Misanthrope, which he titled The Slave of Truth, Tartuffe and The Imaginary Invalid).",
