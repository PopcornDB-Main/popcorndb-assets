Ikehata also uses his stage name of Peter (\u30d4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc P\u012bt\u0101) when he appears on TV variety shows and musical revues.\n\nAlways seen dancing with tight shirts and pants at dancing clubs, he adopted the stage name when he was 16 after his style of dress and dance which was said to resemble Peter Pan. One of Japan's most famous gay entertainers, Peter's androgynous appearance has enabled him to often play transgender or female characters and he often appears on stage in women's clothing (he does not identify as female, however).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Peter, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
