Born in Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, Ram\u00edrez moved to the United States when they were eight years old, eventually graduating with a fine arts degree from the Juilliard School.\n\nRam\u00edrez began acting in Broadway productions, making their debut in Paul Simon's The Capeman, and later ventured into film and television roles.

Ram\u00edrez was offered to pick their own primetime television show in an array of ABC lineups, choosing Grey's Anatomy. They portrayed Dr. Callie Torres, the longest-running LGBT character in US television history, appearing in 11 seasons and 239 episodes. Ram\u00edrez's volunteered addition of the character's bisexuality marked one of the earliest series regular queer roles on primetime television. Following their departure from the series, Ramirez came out as bisexual and later nonbinary, using they/them pronouns. They later portrayed the bisexual, nonbinary roles of Kat Sandoval in Madam Secretary and Che D\u00edaz in And Just Like That\u2026, the modern reboot of Sex and the City, respectively.\n\nRamirez debuted as a voice actor in the 1999 video game entitled UmJammer Lammy, and has voiced Queen Miranda in the animated series Sofia the First (2012\u20132018). Ram\u00edrez released their first single \"Silent Night\" in 2009. Their self-titled EP debuted at no. 37 on the Billboard 200 in 2011.\n\nRam\u00edrez's extensive campaigns for LGBT rights won the Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation in 2015. Ram\u00edrez has also been the recipient of a Tony Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Satellite Award, among other accolades.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sara Ramirez, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
