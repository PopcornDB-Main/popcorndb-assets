Two years later she became Bing Crosby's second wife. The couple had three children, Harry, Mary Frances, and Nathaniel. She appeared as a guest star on her husband's 1964\u20131965 ABC sitcom The Bing Crosby Show.\n\nShe largely retired after their marriage, but did have a featured role in the courtroom drama Anatomy of a Murder. She also played the part of \"Mama Bear\" alongside her husband and children in Goldilocks and starred with Jack Lemmon in Operation Mad Ball in 1957.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, she hosted The Kathryn Crosby Show, a 30-minute local talk-show on KPIX-TV in San Francisco.
