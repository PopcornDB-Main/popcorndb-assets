        "biography": "For someone who goes only to movie theaters, Frank Aletter is a total stranger. It is true that the actor appeared in no more than a handful of theatrical films (Gerhart in Mister Roberts (1955), a commanding officer in Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970), Leigh Jensen in Private School (1983)...). But for a TV fan things are just the opposite, for Aletter was cast in NEARLY ALL the TV series, films, sitcoms and specials shot between 1955 and 1991! A sample of titles just give you an idea of Frank Aletter's prolific output on the small screen: Bringing Up Buddy (1960), Perry Mason (1957), The Cara Williams Show (1964), Lassie (1954), Mannix (1967), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969), Insight (1960), Kojak (1973), Cannon (1971), Hunter (1976), \"Super Jaimie\"... In his first life, Frank Aletter had been a regular on Broadway appearing in plays and musicals like \"Bells Are Ringing\", \"Time Limit\", \"Wish You Were Here\" and of course \"Mister Roberts\", which opened to him the doors of filmed fiction.",
