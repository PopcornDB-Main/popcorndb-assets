In his late teens, Kevin competed in amateur-level auto racing on many surfaces, including asphalt and ice. In 2007, after many years of working as a service advisor for car dealerships, Kevin decided to pursue his lifelong dream of being a professional stunt driver. After going to stunt-driving school, Kevin landed a part-time job stunt driving for the live show Lights, Motors, Action, Extreme Stunt Show at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Fla., where he continued to work until it's close in April of 2016. Now residing just south of Atlanta, Georgia, Kevin is making a name for himself as one of the top stunt drivers in Hollywood. His work ranges from stunt driving to full-body fire burns to acting for films, TV shows, commercials, and live events. In 2018, Kevin opened Dynamic Stunts, where he builds and rents modified stunt cars to the film industry.",
