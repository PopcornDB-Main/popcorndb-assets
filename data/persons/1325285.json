She is now a working actress and a best-selling author. Her memoir Rivoglio La Mia Vita (Claim My Life) was on the Italian bestseller list within a week. Veronica now tours Italy speaking openly about rape, abuse and the importance of breaking the silence as a tool for healing and change.\n\nHer second book Riprenditi La Tua Vita \u2014 Le otto chiavi di Veronica (Take Back Your Life \u2014 Veronica's eight keys), was published in Italy May 2009.\n\nShe is the founder of the Associazione Veronica De Laurentiis, a foundation to stop domestic violence.\n\nIn March 2008, she was chosen to play the role of the \"mater dolorosa\" in the Italian show \"D'Ambra Grigia E Canfora\" directed by Raffaele Curi and produced by Fondazione Alda Fendi.
