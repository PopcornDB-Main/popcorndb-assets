        "biography": "Jean Douchet (January 19, 1929 \u2013 November 22, 2019) was a French film director, historian, film critic and teacher who began his career in the early 1950s at Gazette du Cin\u00e9ma and Cahiers du cinema with members of the future French New Wave.\n\nAs a journalist Douchet wrote extensively about New Wave filmmakers, as well as such directors as Alfred Hitchcock, F. W. Murnau, Kenji Mizoguchi, Vincente Minnelli, Akira Kurosawa, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Daniel Pollet. He enabled Serge Daney to begin working for Cahiers. He also acted in small roles for such directors as Godard, Rohmer, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean Eustache, Jacques Rivette, Jean Pierre Lefebvre and Fran\u00e7ois Ozon. He taught at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Cin\u00e9matographiques and his students included Ozon, \u00c9milie Deleuze and Xavier Beauvois. He was also involved with the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise and regularly hosts screenings and events. For the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que's 2010 tribute to the then recently deceased \u00c9ric Rohmer he made the documentary Claude et \u00c9ric, an interview with Claude Chabrol about Rohmer's early days at Cahiers du cinema.\n\nOn November 22, 2019, the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise announced that Jean Douchet had died at age 90.\n\nSource: Article \"Jean Douchet\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
