        "biography": "A member of the Wichita tribe, Myers was born in Phoenix, Arizona. Influenced by the arts from a young age, her grandfather, Bobby Hill, was a well-known painter who worked under the name White Buffalo and her grandmother was an acclaimed beader whose work has been displayed in the Smithsonian. Myers was raised in Prescott Valley where she had an innate love for bringing characters to life, and in her early twenties began taking acting courses driving over four hours a day to class, which she now says prepared her for the traffic in L.A.\n\nIn 2011 she made the move to southern California, where she began to hone her craft in writing. She was accepted into the 4th Annual Native American Writers Lab, and that same year was a semi-finalist in the ABC/Disney writers program. In 2020 Myers was one of twelve writers selected as a part of A3 Artist Agency's The Colony program, creating a television pilot which is now in production. She finished the year as a Fellow of the Native American Feature Film Writers' Lab. Recent credits for Myers include roles on NBC's award-winning series \"This Is Us,\" and \"Rutherford Falls.\"\n\nCurrent writing projects include two scripts that are in development, a documentary that is in production and one feature in preproduction. In addition to her work in film and television, Myers is passionate about helping others, and created CRASH Cares whose main focus is to create care packages for the homeless in Hollywood. She currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband Josh and their pup.",
