        "biography": "Giovannie Cruz was born on an American military installation in Wuerzburg, Germany to parents from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. Her family relocated to Texas where she grew up and she eventually attended the University of North Texas College of Music where she got her Bachelor's Degree in Opera & Early Music. In the years since, Giovannie has worked in film, television, and as an anime voice actor & music director for Sony's FUNimation Productions (now Crunchyroll Productions).\n\nIn 2019 Giovannie appeared in back-to-back Warner Brothers blockbusters, \"The Suicide Squad\" (directed by James Gunn), and \"Reminiscence\" (directed by \"West World\" Co-Creator Lisa Joy-Nolan) where she appeared on screen across Hugh Jackman. She's also made TV appearances in \"Queen of the South\", \"Queen Sugar\", \"NCIS: New Orleans\", and more.\n\nDuring the devastating C19 Pandemic, Giovannie had the fortune to be called up by James Gunn again to work on \"The Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3\" and its accompanying \"Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\". She also was invited back to work with Horror Film icon Barbara Crampton on Crampton's second undertaking at producing; the subsequent film, \"Suitable Flesh\" (directed by Joe Lynch) made its world premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival where it opened to much acclaim.\n\nIn her downtime, Giovannie spends time writing, producing feature films, and exploring the vast landscapes of California and Texas as an avid hiker and camper. She also mentors actors as part of her personal mission to elevate her home community in Texas to a status on par with other markets such as New York and Los Angeles. She loves animals, live music, coffee, moving her body, and great reads (although she's guilty of having books read to her through audio-books.)\n\nGiovannie is repped in NY & Los Angeles (BAC Talent), the South Central U.S.(Linda McAlister Talent), and the South Eastern U.S. (Action Talent Agency).",
