He lived in Kenya until he was twelve years old, when he moved to India with his family. While living in India, he became interested in films, and when his family moved to Feltham, he became involved in show business. His first film was Candleshoe (1977), as a stand-in. When stunt coordinator Bob Anderson asked him to do stunts as well, his career was started. Shah played the part of Bolum in The People That Time Forgot (1977).  Shah is often confused with Deep Roy; they are both dwarf Nairobi-born Kenyan actors of Indian descent who got their starts in film and television in the late 1970s. He is the world's shortest stuntman according to the Guinness World Records. He has appeared as an actor in 31 films; and 37 as stuntman or body double.",
