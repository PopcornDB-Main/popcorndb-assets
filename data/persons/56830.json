She was a popular actress, regarded as an icon of Chinese cinema, who acted in both Taiwanese and Hong Kong films. She retired in 1994, although she had a minor role in the 1998 film Bishonen.\n\nShe was born in\u00a0Taipei, and was \"discovered\" in 1972 by a film producer, and first appeared in many Taiwanese\u00a0romance films\u00a0based on the novels of\u00a0Chiung Yao. Her movie debut is in\u00a0Chuangwai. She later switched over to making movies in Hong Kong. At the height of her popularity she was arguably one of the most sought-after actresses in the Chinese film industry. She starred in more than 100 movies.\n\nIn Hong Kong movies, Lin made a career of playing\u00a0transgender\u00a0roles: in\u00a0Peking Opera Blues\u00a0she plays a\u00a0tomboy\u00a0who dresses in male Western clothes; in\u00a0New Dragon Gate Inn\u00a0she is a woman who dresses as a man, and in\u00a0Swordsman II\u00a0and\u00a0III\u00a0she plays a male character who\u00a0castrates\u00a0himself for power and so is now slowly turning into a woman. She had a good working relationship with\u00a0Tsui Hark, acting in many of the films he directed (like\u00a0Peking Opera Blues) and produced (Swordsman II).\n\nShe married businessman\u00a0Michael Ying\u00a0in 1994 and left the film industry. She has two daughters, born in 1997 and 2001.
