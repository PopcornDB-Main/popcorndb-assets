Her first 'main' role came when she portrayed Gilberte Doinel, the mother of the main character in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1959 film The 400 Blows. Another notable early role of hers was as Christiane Colombey, the bigamist wife of the main character in the 1963 film La Cuisine au beurre.\n\nIn 1978, she had a notable role in \u00c9douard Molinaro's film La Cage aux Folles as Simone.
