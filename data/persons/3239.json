He directed Mighty Joe Young at RKO in 1949, which was a reunion film of the main King Kong creative team (Cooper, Rose, and O'Brien).\n\nHe married screenwriter, Ruth Rose. They are interred together at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ernest B.
