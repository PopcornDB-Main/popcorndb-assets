He has been called the cinema\u2019s \u201cfirst man in space.\u201d His comedy wasn\u2019t imported from Vaudeville or the British Music Hall like his contemporaries, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Harold learned to use the camera the way other comics used a bowler hat or a funny walk.  In 1917 he shed the comedic clown personas prevalent in comedy for hundreds of years and pioneered romantic comedy by the ordinary guy up on the screen \u2013- a guy with faults, and fears, \u201cthe boy next door.\u201d With his young man in horned-rimmed glasses, he created classic films.",
