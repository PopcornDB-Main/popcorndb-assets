        "biography": "Terence Oliver Blanchard\u00a0(born March 13, 1962) is an American jazz trumpeter and composer. He has also written two operas and more than 80 film and television scores. Blanchard has been nominated for two\u00a0Academy Awards\u00a0for Original Score for\u00a0BlacKkKlansman\u00a0(2018) and\u00a0Da 5 Bloods, both directed by\u00a0Spike Lee, a frequent collaborator.\u00a0\n\nBlanchard started his career in 1980, playing in the\u00a0Lionel Hampton Orchestra\u00a0while studying jazz at\u00a0Rutgers University. In 1982, just before he turned 20, he dropped out of Rutgers to join\u00a0The Jazz Messengers, launching a professional career now in its fifth decade. The\u00a0Metropolitan Opera\u00a0in New York staged Blanchard's opera\u00a0Fire Shut Up in My Bones\u00a0in its 2021\u20132022 season, the first opera by an\u00a0African American\u00a0composer in the organization's history.\n\nBlanchard is also a passionate educational mentor. From 2000 to 2011, Blanchard served as artistic director of the\u00a0Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. In 2011, he was named artistic director of the Henry Mancini Institute at the\u00a0University of Miami, and in 2015, he became a visiting scholar in jazz composition at the\u00a0Berklee College of Music. In 2019, the\u00a0University of California, Los Angeles\u00a0(UCLA) named Blanchard to its Endowed Chair in Jazz Studies, where he remained until 2023. In 2023, SFJAZZ announced the appointment of Blanchard as Executive Artistic Director. He leads the organization's artistic programming and guides its overall creative direction.\n\nBlanchard was selected as the 2024 National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters. The program is one of the most prestigious honours in jazz. Abbey Lincoln, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Sonny Rollins are among the 173 fellows recognized by the NEA as great figures of jazz.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Terence Blanchard, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
