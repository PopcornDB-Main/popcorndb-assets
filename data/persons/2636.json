        "biography": "Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock\u00a0(August 13, 1899 \u2013 April 29, 1980) was an English film director. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in cinema history.\u00a0In a career spanning six decades, he directed over 50 feature films, many of which are still widely watched and studied today. Known as the \"Master of Suspense\", Hitchcock became as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews,\u00a0cameo appearances\u00a0in most of his films, and hosting and producing the television anthology\u00a0Alfred Hitchcock Presents\u00a0(1955\u201365). His films garnered 46\u00a0Academy Award\u00a0nominations, including six wins. However, despite five nominations, he never won the \u00a0Best Director award.\n\nHitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copywriter before entering the film industry in 1919 as a\u00a0title card\u00a0designer. The British\u2013German\u00a0silent film\u00a0The Pleasure Garden\u00a0(1925) was his directorial debut. His first successful film,\u00a0The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog\u00a0(1927), helped to shape the\u00a0thriller\u00a0genre, and\u00a0Blackmail\u00a0(1929) was the first British \"talkie\". His thrillers\u00a0The 39 Steps\u00a0(1935) and\u00a0The Lady Vanishes\u00a0(1938) are ranked among the\u00a0greatest British films\u00a0of the 20th century. By 1939, he had international recognition and producer\u00a0David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including\u00a0Rebecca(1940),\u00a0Foreign Correspondent\u00a0(1940),\u00a0Suspicion (1941),\u00a0Shadow of a Doubt\u00a0(1943) and\u00a0Notorious (1946).\u00a0Rebecca\u00a0won the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Picture, with Hitchcock nominated as Best Director.
