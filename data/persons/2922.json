Karloff is best remembered for his roles in horror films and his portrayal of Frankenstein's monster in Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), and Son of Frankenstein (1939). His popularity following Frankenstein was such that for a brief time he was billed simply as \"Karloff\" or \"Karloff the Uncanny\". His best-known non-horror role is as the Grinch in the television special of Dr. Seuss\u2019s How the Grinch Stole Christmas!.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Boris Karloff, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
