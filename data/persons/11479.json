        "biography": "Charles Lewis Low (July 21, 1928 \u2013 September 18, 2017) was an American actor.\n\nLow was born in New York City, to a Russian mother and Austrian-Polish father. He achieved his biggest success as Morris \"Morrie\" Kessler in the Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas (1990). The character of Morrie was famous for his \"Morrie's Wig Shop\" commercial which is seen as comical, and that coupled with his penchant for pestering Jimmy Conway about money leads most of the characters to see him as a nuisance, setting up his eventual murder by Tommy DeVito. Kessler's character is based on Martin Krugman. He was also known for wearing his dark brown leather blazer.\n\nHe has had small roles in other Robert De Niro films, such as The Mission, The King of Comedy, and most notably in Sergio Leone's 1984 film Once Upon a Time in America as Deborah and Fat Moe's father. He also guest starred in a first-season episode of The Sopranos, as Shlomo Teittleman. He can also be seen in Alan Taylor's 2003 film, Kill the Poor.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",
