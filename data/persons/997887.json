        "biography": "Ronda Jean Rousey\u00a0(/\u02c8ra\u028azi/\u00a0ROW-zee; born February 1, 1987) is an American\u00a0professional wrestler, actress, and former\u00a0judoka\u00a0and\u00a0mixed martial artist. She is best known for her tenures in the\u00a0Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0(UFC) and\u00a0WWE.\n\nShe was the first American woman to win an\u00a0Olympic medal in judo\u00a0by winning bronze at the\u00a02008 Summer Olympics.\u00a0Lynn Roethke\u00a0had previously won a silver medal in the 1988 Olympics. However, her medal was not counted toward the US medal count because Women's Judo was a demonstration sport. Rousey began her mixed martial arts (MMA) career with\u00a0King of the Cage\u00a0in 2011. She soon joined\u00a0Strikeforce, becoming their last\u00a0Women's Bantamweight Champion, holding the championship until the UFC acquired Strikeforce. Rousey was part of the UFC's first female fight at\u00a0UFC 157, was their inaugural\u00a0Women's Bantamweight Champion, and held the record for most UFC title defences (6) by a female until being surpassed by\u00a0Valentina Shevchenko\u00a0in 2022. Rousey retired from MMA in 2016 and was the first female fighter inducted into the\u00a0UFC Hall of Fame\u00a0in 2018.\n\nRousey began a career in\u00a0professional wrestling\u00a0in 2018, signing with WWE,\u00a0and debuted at\u00a0WrestleMania 34. She won the\u00a0Raw Women's Championship\u00a0at that year's\u00a0SummerSlam. She headlined WWE's first and only all women's pay-per-view\u00a0Evolution, in which she defended the title. Rousey lost the title in the first women's\u00a0WrestleMania\u00a0main event at\u00a0WrestleMania 35. Rousey returned at the\u00a02022 Royal Rumble, winning the women's\u00a0Royal Rumble match. That year, she would win the\u00a0SmackDown Women's Championship twice, making her an overall three-time women's world champion in WWE. She became the\u00a0eighth Women's Triple Crown Champion\u00a0when she won the\u00a0WWE Women's Tag Team Championship\u00a0with\u00a0Shayna Baszler. Rousey and Baszler also unified the WWE and\u00a0NXT Women's Tag Team Championships. After leaving WWE in October 2023, she began wrestling on the\u00a0independent circuit.\n\nRousey is the only woman to become a champion in both the UFC and WWE, as well as the only woman to headline a pay-per-view event in both companies.\u00a0She was voted the best female athlete of all time in a 2015 ESPN fan poll, and\u00a0Fox Sports\u00a0described her as \"one of the defining athletes of the 21st century.\" Rousey has also appeared in films, including\u00a0The Expendables 3\u00a0(2014), Furious 7\u00a0(2015),\u00a0and\u00a0Mile 22\u00a0(2018), and published her\u00a0autobiography,\u00a0My Fight / Your Fight, in 2015.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ronda Rousey, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
