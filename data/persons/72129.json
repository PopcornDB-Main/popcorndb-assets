        "biography": "Jennifer Shrader Lawrence\u00a0(born August 15, 1990) is an American actress and producer. She is known for starring in both action film franchises and independent dramas, and her films have grossed over $6\u00a0billion worldwide. The\u00a0world's highest-paid actress\u00a0in 2015 and 2016, she appeared on\u00a0Time's\u00a0100 most influential people in the world\u00a0list in 2013 and the\u00a0Forbes\u00a0Celebrity 100\u00a0list from 2013 to 2016.\u00a0Her accolades\u00a0include an\u00a0Academy Award, a\u00a0British Academy Film Award, three\u00a0Golden Globe Awards, and a\u00a0Peabody Award.\n\nLawrence began her career as a teenager with guest roles on television. Her first major role was as a main cast member on the sitcom\u00a0The Bill Engvall Show\u00a0(2007\u20132009). She made her film debut with a supporting role in the drama\u00a0Garden Party\u00a0(2008). She had her breakthrough playing a poverty-stricken teenager in the independent film\u00a0Winter's Bone\u00a0(2010). Lawrence gained stardom portraying the mutant\u00a0Mystique\u00a0in the\u00a0X-Men\u00a0film series\u00a0(2011\u20132019) and\u00a0Katniss Everdeen\u00a0in\u00a0The Hunger Games\u00a0film series\u00a0(2012\u20132015). The latter made her the highest-grossing\u00a0action heroine.\n\nLawrence collaborated with filmmaker\u00a0David O. Russell\u00a0on three films, all of which garnered her significant recognition. For portraying a troubled young widow in the romance\u00a0Silver Linings Playbook\u00a0(2012), she won the\u00a0Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the\u00a0second-youngest winner in the category at age 22. Lawrence won the\u00a0BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role\u00a0for playing an unpredictable wife in the black comedy\u00a0American Hustle\u00a0(2013). She also received\u00a0Golden Globe Awards\u00a0for both, and for portraying businesswoman\u00a0Joy Mangano\u00a0in the biopic\u00a0Joy (2015). A series of mixed reviews and media scrutiny of her role choices led to a small break from acting. Lawrence returned with the black comedy\u00a0Don't Look Up\u00a0(2021), after which she produced and starred in the drama\u00a0Causeway\u00a0(2022) and the comedy\u00a0No Hard Feelings (2023). In 2025, she received renewed critical attention for her lead role in the psychological drama\u00a0Die, My Love.\n\nLawrence is a\u00a0feminist\u00a0and advocates for women's\u00a0reproductive rights. In 2015, she founded the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation, which advocates for the\u00a0Boys & Girls Clubs of America\u00a0and the\u00a0Special Olympics.
