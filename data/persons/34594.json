        "biography": "Sacha Pito\u00ebff (born Alexandre Pito\u00ebff; 11 March 1920 \u2013 21 July 1990) was a Swiss-born French actor and stage director.\n\nPito\u00ebff was born in Geneva, Switzerland, on 11 March 1920, the son of Russian-born parents Ludmilla (n\u00e9e Smanova) and Georges Pito\u00ebff. Both of his parents were born in the city of Tbilisi (in modern-day Georgia), then a part of the Russian Empire. The Pito\u00ebffs were prominent actors in France, Georges was a founding member of the Cartel des Quatre (Group of Four), a group including Louis Jouvet, Charles Dullin, and Gaston Baty, dedicated to rejuvenating the French theatre.\n\nSacha graduated from Lyc\u00e9e Pasteur in Neuilly-sur-Seine, outside Paris. He studied acting and stage direction under Jouvet at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e.\n\nDuring World War II, the younger Pito\u00ebff followed his mother back to Switzerland, where he played his earliest roles. After the war he returned to Paris, becoming general manager at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes du Nord. He made his directorial debut with a 1950 staging of Uncle Vanya, which proved both a critical and commercial success.\n\nHe became a fixture of Parisian theatre in the 1960s, becoming the director of his own troupe. His repertoire included works by Jean Genet, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Hugo Claus, Robert Musil, Anna Langfus and Anton Chekhov. With Romy Schneider, he staged The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre.\n\nIn 1967, he achieved his greatest success with a well-regarded production of Luigi Pirandello's Henry IV, which he directed and starred in, with Claude Jade.\n\nPito\u00ebff played his first film role in 1952, in the omnibus film The Seven Deadly Sins. Appearing in over 50 films, he is probably best known for his performance in Alain Resnais's enigmatic Last Year at Marienbad (1960), as the unnamed man who may or may not be Delphine Seyrig's husband.\n\nHe was featured in roles of various sizes in such films as Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Espions (1957), Peter Ustinov's Lady L (1965), Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment's Is Paris Burning? (1966), and Jacques Demy's Donkey Skin (1970). He also appeared in several Hollywood productions, including Anatole Litvak's Anastasia (1956) and The Night of the Generals (1967), Mark Robson's The Prize (1963) and Dick Clement's To Catch a Spy (1971).\n\nToward the end of his acting career, he began appearing in horror films. His final role was as the bookseller Kazanian in Dario Argento's Inferno (1980).\n\nFor the last ten years of his life, Pito\u00ebff was a professor at the National School of Theatre Arts and Techniques (ENSATT) in Lyon, where his students included G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Jean-Roger Milo and Niels Arestrup.\n\nPito\u00ebff was married to French actress Luce Garcia-Ville, until her death by suicide in 1975. He had two siblings, actress Svetlana Pito\u00ebff and writer Aniouta Pitoeff.\n\nHis height and distinctively-gaunt, lanky appearance may have been a consequence of Marfan syndrome.\n\nHaving suffered from depression in the final years of his life, he died in Paris at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital on 21 July 1990, at the age of 70.\n\nSource: Article \"Sacha Pito\u00ebff\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
