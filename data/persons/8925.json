She is known for her roles in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007), The Ninth Gate (1999) and Frantic (1988). She has been nominated for a C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress for Venus in Fur (2013), and for two C\u00e9sar Awards for Best Supporting Actress in Place Vend\u00f4me (1998) and La Vie En Rose (2007). She has been married to Polish film director Roman Polanski since 1989.\n\nSeigner is the daughter of Jean-Louis Seigner (1941-2020), photographer, and Aline Ponelle, journalist. She is the older sister of Mathilde Seigner, actress, and Marie-Am\u00e9lie Seigner, singer. Through their father, they are the granddaughters of the actor Louis Seigner (1903-1991) and the nieces of the actress Fran\u00e7oise Seigner (1928-2008), both deans and members of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. She is the niece of doctor V\u00e9ronique Vasseur.\n\nShe was educated at a Catholic convent school, and began modelling at the age of fourteen.\n\nHer husband directed her in Frantic (1988), Bitter Moon (1992), The Ninth Gate (1999), Venus in Fur (2013), Based On A True Story (2017) and An Officer and a Spy (2019). In 2010, Seigner was featured in Jerzy Skolimowski's Essential Killing, which went on to win the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 2012, she played the principal role of Vanda in Polanski's French film adaptation of David Ives's two-character play Venus in Fur, based on the Austrian novel of the near-same name, for which she received praise as Vanda, an actress, playing against writer and theatre director Thomas played by Mathieu Amalric.\n\nSeigner appears as the main character in the music video \"Hands Around My Throat\" by Death in Vegas. In 2006, she became the lead singer of the pop rock band Ultra Orange, and the group's name was changed to Ultra Orange & Emmanuelle. They released a self-titled album in 2007.
