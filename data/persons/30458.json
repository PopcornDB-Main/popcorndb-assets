He was the director for The Believer and Noise.\n\nBean is also the inspiration for the main protagonist of Noise. He was so tired of constant noise around him and his home in New York that he decided to take the law into his own hands. If a car alarm was going off and the owner of the vehicle didn't rectify the situation, Bean would break into the car to disable the offending car alarm. Bean was eventually arrested and jailed. He admits to doing it a few more times since\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Henry Bean, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
