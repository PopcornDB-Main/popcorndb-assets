He also appeared on many TV shows and commercials, including a Baggies spot in the 1960s, as well as the first of a popular series of commercials for the American Express charge card (\"Do you know me?\").\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article John McGiver, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
