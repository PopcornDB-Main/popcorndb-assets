        "biography": "Robert X. Golphin is an American award-nominated actor, award-winning filmmaker/screenwriter, author, motivational speaker/orator, and journalist from Philadelphia,Pennsylvania. He is best known for his portrayal of Dunbar Reed in the\u00a0The Great Debaters\u00a0(2007), in which he acted opposite\u00a0Denzel Washington,Nate Parker, andJermaine Williams.  Some of Robert's other work include HBO's\u00a0\n\nThe Wire\u00a0(2002) and the indie featuresRounding First\u00a0(2005) and\u00a0The Beautiful Ordinary\u00a0(2007).  But it is perhaps the short film genre where Robert's range is on full display. His slender physique may brand him unconventional by Hollywood's standards, but that's exactly what makes him stand out from the crowd. His complex and diverse roles include an Obama-esque civil rights attorney in 2009's \"In Heaven's Court\", a lovestruck artist type in\u00a0\n\nSimply Untitled\u00a0(2004), a heroin addict in\u00a0Track Marks\u00a0(2005) (called \"Sincere and hand-wringing\" by 'The Philadelphia Weekly', and a nobody turned superstar in the award-winning\u00a0Beautiful Man in the Buff\u00a0(2008), in which he picked up a \"Best Actor\" nod at the Downbeach Film Festival.  Robert also starred as a young man who wrestles with his sexuality in the multiple award-winning drama\u00a0\n\nPunch Me\u00a0(2011), opposite\u00a0Brian Anthony Wilson, and as a young husband affected by the cycle of domestic abuse in\u00a0Un-Perfect\u00a0(2011) oppositeChristopher Mann. Both of his co-stars had recurring roles on HBO's\u00a0The Wire\u00a0(2002).  Robert has been called a \"renaissance man\". And for good reason. He is certainly one to watch...",
