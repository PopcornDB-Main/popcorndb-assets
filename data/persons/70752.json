He has worked extensively in Australian film, television and theatre for over thirty years.\n\nHis debut was in 1969 in the film Strange holiday (based on the novel by Jules Verne). He starred in the 1987 Australian television drama Vietnam (one of Nicole Kidman's early roles) and the 1989 cult film Everlasting Secret Family. Most of his work has drawn little notice outside of Australia, save for a short film Stranger so familiar, shown in the 2005 Reno Film Festival. He starred as a gay man in Sex is a four letter word.\n\nIn 2001, Mark starred in the one man show The time machine, adapted by Frank Gauntlett from the novelette by H.G.
