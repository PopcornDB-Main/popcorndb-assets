        "biography": "Bj\u00f6rn Kristian Ulvaeus (born 25 April 1945) is a Swedish musician, singer, songwriter, and producer best known as a member of the musical group ABBA. He is also the co-composer of the musicals Chess, Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la, and Mamma Mia! He co-produced the films Mamma Mia! and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again with fellow ABBA member and close friend Benny Andersson. He is the oldest member of the group.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Kristian Ulvaeus was born in Gothenburg on 25 April 1945. In 1951, he moved with his family to V\u00e4stervik, Kalmar County. His parents were Aina Eliza Viktoria (n\u00e9e Bengtsson; 1909\u20132005) and Erik Gunnar Ulvaeus (1912\u20131999). Ulvaeus has one sister, Eva Margareta (born 1948). Ulvaeus studied business and law at Lund University after undertaking his military service, alongside comedian Magnus Holmstr\u00f6m.\n\nBefore gaining international recognition with ABBA, Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-schlager band Hootenanny Singers, known earlier as the \"West Bay Singers\", who had an enormous following in Scandinavia. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the Hep Stars, and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group's keyboard player, Benny Andersson. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: \"Isn't It Easy To Say\", a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: \"A Flower in My Garden\", recorded by Hep Stars, and their first real hit \"Ljuva Sextiotal\", for which Stig Anderson wrote lyrics. The latter, a cabar\u00e9t-style ironic song about the 1960s, was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for the Eurovision Song Contest, but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva Brita Borg. Another hit came in 1969 with \"Speleman\", also recorded by Hep Stars.\n\nWhile filming a nostalgic schlager special for television in March 1969, Bj\u00f6rn met eighteen-year-old future wife and singer-songwriter Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus continued recording and touring with Hootenanny Singers to great acclaim while working as in-house producer at Polar Record Company (headed by future manager Stig Anderson), with Benny as his new partner. The twosome produced records by other artists and continued writing songs together. Polar artist Arne Lamberts Swedish version of \"A Flower in My Garden\" (\"Fr\u00f6ken Bl\u00e5klint\") was one of Bj\u00f6rn & Benny's first in-house productions. In December 1969, they recorded the new song \"She's My Kind of Girl\", which became their first single as a duo. It was released in March 1970, giving them a minor hit in Sweden and a top-ten hit in Japan two years later.\n\nThe Hootenanny Singers entered Svensktoppen, the Swedish radio charts, in 1970 with \"Omkring Tiggarn Fr\u00e5n Luossa\", a cover of an old folk-schlager song. It remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks, a record which endured until 1990; the song was produced by Bj\u00f6rn and Benny, and had Ulvaeus's solo vocal and Benny's piano. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
