He worked with notable playwrights of the time, such as Satyadev Dubey and Girish Karnad. However, he is primarily remembered for essaying some iconic negative roles in Hindi cinema. He is most remembered for his role as Mogambo in the Hindi film Mr India (1987). As Mola Ram in the Hollywood film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), he crossed over to international cinema as well.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Amrish Puri, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
