The aspiring actor studied in New York City at NYU's prestigious Tisch School of the Arts and reverted to his family's Russian surname upon joining the theatrical performer's union The Actor's Equity.\n\nHis talent for finding the heart of even the most minor characters first surfaced in 1989's Last Exit to Brooklyn, which he followed with a string of appearances on everything from the gadget-happy sitcom Home Improvement (ABC, 1991-99), to the medical drama Chicago Hope (CBS, 1994-2000).\n\nMany of his film roles showcased his signature mix of everyman amiability and stoic intensity: there's the Navy SEAL instructor in G.I. Jane (1997); low-key cop in The Bone Collector (1999); greedy oil executive in There Will Be Blood (2007); and longtime CIA agent in the Taken trilogy.\n\nHe served as an assistant professor of theatre acting at the University of Southern California, and later juggled his promotion to Head of Acting with a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Lincoln (2012).\u00a0",
