He had a number-one hit with \"Singin' in the Rain\" in 1929. He also did voices for animated cartoons later in his career, and is best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket in Walt Disney's Pinocchio (1940) and Fun and Fancy Free (1947). His rendition of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" in Pinocchio is probably his most familiar recorded legacy.",
