        "biography": "Pierre Repp (5 November 1909 in Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, France \u2013 1 November 1986 in Plessis-Tr\u00e9vise, France) was a French humorist and actor. His real name was Pierre Alphonse L\u00e9on Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bouclet. On 14 August 1930, he married Ferdinande Alice Andr\u00e9e Bouclet in Lille.\n\nHe is famous in France for his unique comic talent. He used to simulate stuttering while talking, in a humoristic way, trying to pronounce some words and finally replacing them by others. In a famous French sketch, \"Les cr\u00eapes\", he explained the recipe that way, with sentences like this one: \"Then you add some mamerlade, oh sorry ! Some marlamade... Uh! Me, I pour some chocolate\".\n\nPierre Repp appeared in many theatre plays and TV shows, but mainly in music-hall and cabarets in Paris or on tour. Pierre Repp has his place in the French cin\u00e9ma story due to many \"third-roles\" in about forty films.\n\nSource: Article \"Pierre Repp\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
