        "biography": "Carsten is an actor and producer who graduated from The Oxford School of Drama in 2000, upon which he made his professional acting debut in a West End production of Noel Coward's \"Semi Monde\".\n\nHe was raised bilingually by his British mother and German father, and during his youth they moved quite often. As a result, Carsten grew up experiencing a diverse range of countries such as Nigeria, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, India and Egypt to name a few. Quite often TV and cinema weren't readily available, and so school plays became a treasured experience. Notwithstanding his first role, where as a 6yr old he played a flying monkey in \"The Wizard of Oz\" complete with itchy woolen onesie in the Arabian heat, he relished each opportunity to act thereafter.\n\nThe decision to pursue acting professionally originated as a fateful coincidence years later. Whilst at the University of St. Andrews, looking for a lecture, he stumbled into the casting for a student production for \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". He was encouraged to try out, got the part and his old passion was rekindled. Two plays and a few months later he applied to drama school, and thus began his professional career.",
