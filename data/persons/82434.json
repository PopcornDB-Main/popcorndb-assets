        "biography": "Wayne Pigram\u00a0(born 13 October 1959), better known by his stage name\u00a0Wayne Pygram, is an Australian actor, known for his role as\u00a0Scorpius\u00a0in the science fiction series\u00a0Farscape\u00a0(2000\u20132003) and the miniseries that followed,\u00a0Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars\u00a0(2004).  Pygram was born in\u00a0Cootamundra, New South Wales and raised in\u00a0Wagga Wagga, where, as a teen, he was a drummer in a dance group. He initially studied art at\u00a0Riverina College of Advanced Education, but later changed majors to primary school education.[1]\u00a0While in college, he became a member of a theatre troupe known as the\u00a0Riverina Trucking Company.[1]Before acting in films and television, he was a regular on the Australian theatre circuit. In 2005, he made a brief cameo in\u00a0Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\u00a0as a young\u00a0Grand Moff Tarkin, because of his resemblance to the late\u00a0Peter Cushing, who portrayed the same character 28 years previously in\u00a0Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.  Due to the brevity of his\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0cameo, and the makeup he wore onFarscape, Pygram's real face may now be known best for his appearance on the TV show\u00a0Lost, as a\u00a0faith healer\u00a0named Isaac of Uluru.  Pygram has also played the drums in numerous bands over the past 20 years, the most recent being a band named Signal Room (formerly called Number 96)[2]\u00a0along with his co-star in\u00a0Farscape,\u00a0Anthony Simcoe. He also teaches the drums at\u00a0Kildare Catholic College, an Australian Catholic school based in Wagga Wagga.",
