He is a leading expert on the Hanna-Barbera and Looney Tune franchises for Warner Brothers Animation.\n\nHis first job was in Chicago on Steven Spielberg's Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs as an animator and storyboard artist. He eventually ended up on the Warner lot in 1994, animating on the theatrical short Carrotblanca. From there, Cervone became the Director of Animation on the feature film Space Jam. Partnered with collaborator Spike Brandt, he went on to create and produce several television shows including the Emmy-award-winning Duck Dodgers, The Looney Tunes Show and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. He also produced and directed several feature-length videos - favorites among them include Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare and Scooby-Doo! And KISS: Rock and Roll Mystery. In addition, Cervone produced six theatrical shorts including Daffy's Rhapsody and I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat in which the Looney Tunes characters were computer-animated for the first time and which used the last of Mel Blanc's recordings. He also produced Joe Barbera's last Tom and Jerry theatrical short.",
