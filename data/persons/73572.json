        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSara Montiel (also Sarita Montiel or Sarit\u00edsima; 10 March 1928 \u2013 8 April 2013) was a Spanish singer and actress. She was a naturalized citizen of Mexico. Montiel was born in Campo de Criptana in the region of Castile\u2013La Mancha in 1928 as Mar\u00eda Antonia Abad (complete name Mar\u00eda Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fern\u00e1ndez). After her work in Juan de Ordu\u00f1a's El \u00daltimo Cupl\u00e9 in 1957, Montiel worked in Europe, Latin America and United States. Montiel's film Varietes was banned in Beijing in 1973. Her films El \u00daltimo Cuple and La Violetera netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s. She played the role of Antonia, the niece of Don Quixote, in the 1947 Spanish film version of Cervantes's great novel.\n\nShe was portrayed in the Pedro Almod\u00f3var film Bad Education by a male actor in drag (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) as the cross-dressing character Zahara, and a film clip from one of her movies was used as well.",
