        "biography": "Roseanne Park (born 11 February 1997), known mononymously as ROS\u00c9 (\ub85c\uc81c), is a Korean-New Zealand singer and dancer based in South Korea. Born in New Zealand and raised in Australia, Ros\u00e9 signed with South Korean label YG Entertainment following a successful audition in 2012 and trained for four years before debuting as a member of the girl group Blackpink in August 2016.\n\nIn March 2021, ROS\u00c9 made her solo debut with her single album R. Its lead single \"On the Ground\" was a commercial success, peaking in the top five domestically and becoming the highest-charting song by a Korean female soloist on the US Billboard Hot 100, the ARIA Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart. It was the first song by a Korean solo artist to top the Billboard Global 200 and the most-viewed music video in 24 hours on YouTube by a solo K-pop artist, which earned ROS\u00c9 two Guinness World Records. The album's second single \"Gone\" peaked in the top ten in South Korea as well.\n\nIn 2024, she signed a management contract with The Black Label. ROS\u00c9 has been acknowledged for her role in fashion as a global ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent, and became the first female Korean idol to attend the Met Gala in 2021.",
