        "biography": "Dani\u00e8le Graule (1 October 1944 \u2013 18 July 2022), known as Dani (sometimes as Dany), was a French actress and singer.\n\nDani was born in Castres. In 1966 she was contracted to Path\u00e9-Marconi and released her first single \"Gar\u00e7on manqu\u00e9\". In 1968 \"Papa vient d'\u00e9pouser la bonne\" sold a million copies and was a major hit. Dani was meant to have been France's Eurovision Song Contest 1974 entry with the song \"La Vie \u00e0 25 ans\", but President Georges Pompidou died in the week of the competition, so she never entered Eurovision properly. Her only English language record release to date was \"That Old Familiar Feeling\", which had the same music as \"La Vie \u00e0 25 ans\" but with English lyrics by British singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul.\n\nOn the cinema screen, she played the script-girl Liliane in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Day for Night and in the last Antoine Doinel-adventure Love on the Run a short-time-affair of Antoine, Christine's friend Liliane. Truffaut who made her famous with one role in two movies: she is Liliane in Day for Night. The fickle girlfriend of actor Alphonse (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) recruited as a script trainee who is pinching for the English stuntman. In 1978, this Liliane became the friend of Christine Doinel alias Claude Jade in the final film of the Doinel cyclus. Truffaut used Liliane's flashbacks for Love on the Run. Here Liliane becomes the best friend of Christine (Claude Jade). And later, she has an affair with her husband Antoine, again Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud. Thanks to the installation of new and old scenes, Claude Jade also mounted in the flashbacks of Day for Night, it seems Dani was already part of the Doinel Cycle.\n\nShe died in Tours on 18 July 2022, aged 77.\n\nSource: Article \"Dani (singer)\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA.",
