        "biography": "Harrison Ressler began his film career in 1974, at the age of 66. After appearing on the television game show \"To Tell The Truth\" as one of the impostors, Producer Mark Goodson suggested he become an actor. In his motion picture career he considered himself privileged to share the screen with actors like Laurence Olivier, Sean Connery, Burgess Meredith, Jeff Bridges, Robert DeNiro, and Zero Mostel.\n\nHis passion for theater and cinema began during his high school years, where he acted in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado\" as Ko-Ko. He was a true renaissance man, writing plays, lyrics, and poetry throughout his formative years.\n\nIn his freshman year at City College he was active in amateur theater, but The Great Depression led him down another path. Married and expecting his first child in 1929, he found work in sales in the NYC garment district, a career that he held for 40 years. During that time he kept his passion for the arts alive, participating in regional amateur theater, composing music, writing lyrics, arranging and performing for the USO during WWII at Camp Kilmer, emceeing at Catskill Mountain resorts, and performing in fraternal and charitable organization productions. Some of his best known songs include 'Shadows in the Moonlight' (1948) and 'Nancy from Delancey'.\n\nHis legacy continues within his own family, as many of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have pursued the arts both personally and professionally, inspired by Harrison's example.",
