In response, she developed and produced a documentary, The Changing Face of Beauty, about American obsession with youth and its effect on women.\n\nWard succeeded\u00a0Candice Bergen\u00a0as commercial spokesperson for\u00a0Sprint's\u00a0long distance phone service (1999-2002).

Ward received her 2nd lead actress Primetime Emmy Award and\u00a0a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama\n\nIn 2004, she played the a private investigator in the TV movie Suburban Madness and she also appeared in the feature\u00a0film The Day After Tomorrow\u00a0with\u00a0Dennis Quaid\u00a0and\u00a0Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nIn 2005, she landed a recurring role in the Fox series\u00a0House\u00a0as Stacy Warner, the hospital's attorney and formidable ex-partner\u00a0of the protagonist Dr. Gregory House\u00a0(Hugh Laurie), until her character was written off the show in 2006.\n\nShe was originally offered both the role of\u00a0Megan Donner\u00a0on\u00a0CSI: Miami\u00a0and\u00a0Susan Mayer\u00a0on\u00a0Desperate Housewives, but turned both down. She was reluctant to commit to another lead role in an hour-long series because of the time away from her family it would require.\n\nAlthough she was on a brief hiatus from TV, she continued to appear in feature films. She starred opposite\u00a0Kevin Costner\u00a0in\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0in 2006 and starred in the thriller\u00a0The Stepfather\u00a0in 2009.\n\nIn July 2010, she signed on to star in\u00a0CSI: NY at the start of the 7th season and remained until the 9th and final season'.
