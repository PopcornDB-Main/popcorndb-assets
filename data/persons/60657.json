One day, he intercepts an official invitation from the prestigious Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet. Through a series of mad antics, he reunites his old orchestra, now composed of old alcoholic musicians, and flies to perform in Paris and complete the Tchaikovsky concerto interrupted 30 years earlier. For the concerto, he engages a young violin soloist with whom he has an unexpected connection.",
