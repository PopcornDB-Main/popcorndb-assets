In 1995, he made his directorial debut with the film \"New Tenant\".\n\nIn 1996, Wong and Yau teamed up again with a cult class horror film \"Ebola Syndrome\". He won his second Hong Kong Film Award for his role as the corrupt police officer Tung in the critically acclaimed \"Beast Cops\" (1998).  Wong continued his success in roles in films such as the \"Young and Dangerous\" franchise, \"The Mission\" (1999), \"Infernal Affairs\" (2002), \"Initial D\" (2005), \"Exiled\" (2006), \"Secret\" (2007), \"Ip Man: The Final Fight\" (2013), \"Still Human\" (2018), and \"The Sunny Side of the Street\" (2022).
