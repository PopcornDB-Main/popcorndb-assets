        "biography": "Sofiane Zermani (born 21 July 1986) is a French rapper of Algerian descent. He's also known as Fianso (verlan of his first name). Born in Saint-Denis, Paris Region, in the northern suburbs of Paris, he lived in the nearby Stains until age 13 when he moved to Le Blanc-Mesnil.\n\nIn 2011, he released independently the album Blacklist followed by Blacklist II in 2013. In 2016, he launched a series of videos titled #JeSuisPass\u00e9ChezSo inviting other less-known rappers to take part. In November 2016, he was signed to Capitol Records, an affiliate of Universal Music France. In January 2017, he released \"Ma cit\u00e9 a craqu\u00e9\" featuring Bakyl. The album #JeSuisPass\u00e9ChezSo, same title as the earlier series has peaked at #2 on SNEP, the French Albums Chart. The album is certified Platinum in May 2017 for selling over 100,000 copies internationally.\n\nIn May 2017 Sofiane released the album Bandit salet\u00e9 (\"Filth bandit\"), which again was certified platinum. For the music video for the song \"Toka\" from the album, Sofiane and around 10 of his crew stood in the middle of the A3 autoroute, blocking cars, while Sofiane rapped the song in front of cameras. The filming was done without a permit. In February 2018 he was fined \u20ac1,500 and given a suspended sentence of four months in jail for obstructing traffic. At the sentencing, Sofiane apologized for his actions, and said that the decision to film there had come to him in a moment of \"bad inspiration\".\n\nSource: Article \"Sofiane (rapper)\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.",
