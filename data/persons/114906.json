She used to do a lot of live action work when she was a teen under the name Ayumi Nagashii and became an idol under the name Kanori Kadomatsu, appearing in men's magazines and V-Cinema. Several of her films were very explicit in violence, sex and nudity.  Trying to break out of the horror/exploitation genre and back into legitimate cinema, she briefly changed her name back to Ayumi Nagashii and began working on the occasional anime as a voice actress. In the late 90s, she changed her name to Ryoka Yuzuki and focused on voice work.",
