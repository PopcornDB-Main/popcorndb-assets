From the late \u201880\u2019s to the mid \u201890\u2019s, Scott was a fashion model from Wickliffe, Ohio and worked in the Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Atlanta markets, and also across the Pacific in Honolulu and Tokyo.

In 1995, Scott was voted to Cleveland Magazine's annual list of \"Most Interesting People\".\n\nWhile modeling in Cleveland and Chicago, Scott would also work as a photo assistant for local photographers. A developed interest to be behind the lens was now created.  Scott has been shooting a variety of media over the years.  One of his latest techniques is 'digitally painting' on his images, which has created some of his latest works.\n\nIn October of 2010, Scott was awarded the job to create 21 original 'digital paintings' for the Great Hall entrance to the new Cuyahoga County Juvenile Justice Center in Cleveland, Ohio.",
