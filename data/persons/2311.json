        "biography": "Otto Sander (German: [\u02c8\u0254to\u02d0 \u02c8zand\u0250]; June 30, 1941 \u2013 September 12, 2013) was a German film, theater, and voice actor.\n\nSander grew up in Kassel, where he graduated in 1961 from the Friedrichgymnasium. After leaving school he spent his military service in 1961/62 with the Bundesmarine and left as reserve fenrik. Sander then studied theatre science, history of art and philosophy. In 1965 he made his acting debut at the D\u00fcsseldorfer chamber plays. After his first film work in the same year he abandoned his studies in 1967, and went to Munich to become a full-time actor.\n\nHis career is closely connected with the Schaub\u00fchne theatre in Berlin under the direction of Peter Stein. From 1980 onwards Sander appeared on several of Berlin's theatre stages, among others at the Schillertheater in 1981, at the Freie Volksb\u00fchne in 1985 and in 1989 at the Kom\u00f6die am Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. More recently he starred in Hauptmann von K\u00f6penick at the Schauspielhaus Bochum (2004).\n\nIn 1990, he was a member of the Jury at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nAmong his best-known film roles are the angel Cassiel in Wings of Desire and its sequel Faraway, So Close! by Wim Wenders, and a shell-shocked U-boat commander, Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Philipp Thomsen, in Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot. Sander also appeared in The Tin Drum (1979) as a trumpeter and in Comedian Harmonists, a biopic about the musical group of the same name. He also played a professor in the movie The Promise about the division of Berlin by the wall. In 1999 he played a role in Rosa von Praunheim's movie The Einstein of Sex.",
