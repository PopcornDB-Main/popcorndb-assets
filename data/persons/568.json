Krizan was featured in Richard Linklater's Slacker (1991) and Waking Life (2001).

Studios Talks Comics,\" discussion, which was moderated by Los Angeles Times writer Geoff Boucher.\n\nShe contributed the story \"Of and Concerning the Ancient, Mystical, and Holy Origins of That Most Down and Dirty 20th Century Rock n' Roll Club: CBGB\" to issue #3 of the CBGB comic book miniseries that hit store shelves in September 2010.
