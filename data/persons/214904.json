In 1933 he started his now famous \"stand up\" act, with the signature blend of piano music and jokes, and married American Elsie Chilton the same year.\u00a0Borge started touring extensively in Europe, where he began telling anti-Nazi\u00a0jokes. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, he was touring Sweden, and\u00a0fled via finland to the USA with his American wife.\n\nOnce in the USA, \u00a0he took the name Victor Borge, and quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. In 1941 he was hired by Bing Crosby for his Kraft Music Hall, and from then on, his fame just grew and grew.",
