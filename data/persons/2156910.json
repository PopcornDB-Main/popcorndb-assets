        "biography": "Pamela Roberts is an actress whose range and commitment to character and her craft put her in a class of her own. She brings a level of warmth, integrity, reality and life to her work that is admirable.\n\nPamela was born on December 8, 1948 in Chicago, Illinois. At a young age she moved to Los Angeles with her parents; where her career in acting began.\n\nIn the 1970s Pamela joined the Paul Robeson Players theatre touring company that led to an opportunity to perform at FESTAC (Festival of Black Art and Culture) in Lagos, Nigeria in 1977. While at FESTAC Pamela had the opportunity to meet the legendary Stevie Wonder who was also in attendance.\n\nPamela has graced the stage playing some of the most powerful characters of our time. Her performances and talent put her on a par with legendary actresses who have stepped into those very same roles: Nurse Ratched (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Lena Younger (A Raisin in the Sun), Maggie Pollitt (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof), Medea (Medea) and Mattie Williams (The River Niger).\n\nPamela's strong theatre background led to a prolific career in both film and television. Through the 1980s she appeared in such popular television shows as Hill Street Blues (1985), Dynasty (1988) and L.A. Law (1989).\n\nIn the 1990s and into the 2000s Pamela's career continued strong with guest appearances on Doogie Howser, M.D. (1991), E.R. (1996), Living Single (1996) and Gabriel's Fire (1990) in which Pamela had the opportunity to work along side legendary actor James Earl Jones. She also guest starred on the popular television show NYPD Blue (2004) and Joan of Arcadia (2004).\n\nIn 2002 Pamela landed a role in the science fiction movie Minority Report from director Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell. As an actress, working under the directorship of Mr. Spielberg, was a memorable learning experience for Pamela.\n\nRecently, Pamela was cast in the heartwarming short film Pacific Edge (2014) starring seven-time Emmy Award winner Ed Asner (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and three-time Emmy Award winner Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible).\n\nPamela lives in Los Angles with her husband, actor Michael D. Roberts, and their 2 children.",
