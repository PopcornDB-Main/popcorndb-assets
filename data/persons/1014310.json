        "biography": "Character actor Walt Gorney was born on April 12, 1912 in Vienna, Austria. He came to the United States of America when he was ten years old and lived with his family in Massachusetts, USA. In 1946, Gorney moved to an apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City, USA. Gorney appeared in a handful of movies in minor roles; he was usually cast as bums or average working class types. With his lean, stringy build, gaunt face, croaky voice, and intense off center movie/film presence, Gorney was perfectly cast as local town eccentric and grim prophet of doom, Crazy Ralph in the horror classic Friday the 13th (1980). He returned as Crazy Ralph in Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) and did the opening narration for Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988). Outside of his regrettably sparse movie credits, Walt had a long and respectable career acting on the stage. Gorney was a member of the theatrical group, the Provincetown Players in the early 1950s.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: woodyanders",
