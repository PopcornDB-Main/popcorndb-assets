Standing at 6 feet 1 inch tall, Massa has become a prominent figure in the stunt industry.\n\nHe began his career in the early 1990s, performing stunts in various television series and films. Massa gained significant recognition as the main stunt double for David Boreanaz in the fantasy series \"Angel\" (1999\u20132004), where he also served as a stunt coordinator for 63 episodes. His exceptional work on the show earned him a nomination for an American Choreography Award in 2002 for Outstanding Achievement in Fight Choreography for the episode \"A New World\".\n\nMassa's film credits are extensive, including work as a stunt performer and coordinator in major productions such as \"Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens,\" \"Blade Runner 2049,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Iron Man 3,\" and \"The Fate of the Furious.\" Notably, he served as a stunt double for Harrison Ford in \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" and \"Blade Runner 2049\".\n\nIn 2004, Massa received the Taurus World Stunt Award for Best Specialty Stunt for his boat work in \"The Italian Job\" (2003), where he piloted a white boat during a high-speed chase scene through Venice's canals. This sequence was directed by Alexander Witt and coordinated by Gary Hymes.\n\nHis contributions to the industry have been recognised with several accolades. In 2009, he was among the stunt performers nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture for \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\" The following year, he won the same award as part of the \"Star Trek\" stunt crew. Additionally, in 2010, he received two Taurus World Stunt Award nominations in the categories of Best High Work and Best Specialty Stunt.\n\nBeyond his on-screen work, Massa is a board member of Stunts Unlimited, a prestigious organisation of elite stunt professionals.
