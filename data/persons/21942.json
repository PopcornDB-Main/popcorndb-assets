After some lesser supporting roles in famous British soap operas and a resident personality on a popular 1990s British game show, The Price is Right, he landed a role in the Jet Li action film Kiss of the Dragon. His performance led to other opportunities such as co-starring with Steven Seagal as the main villain in The Foreigner as well as appearing in Sean Connery's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Later roles include a villain in Jason Statham's Death Race and a supporting role in Sex and the City 2.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Max Ryan, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
