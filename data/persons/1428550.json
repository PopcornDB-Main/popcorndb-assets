        "biography": "Jane Watson is a professional stage and film actress, writer and entrepreneur. She started performing in elementary school and has never looked back. Discovering her passion for theatre motivated her to study as much as she could as a young artist; she was one of the first teenagers to attend the Centre in the Square Summer School for the Performing Arts. That experience came full circle when, after completing her undergraduate degree in Theatre at U of T and her Masters from Binghamton University in New York, she was asked to teach and direct at the same school. Since she is a believer in life long education, Jane has continued to take acting courses, most recently completing intensives with Matthew Harrison and the Actor's Foundry based in Vancouver.  Jane performs regularly in TV and film; most recently in the blockbuster \"Pacific Rim\" directed by Guillermo del Toro. Her stage life is varied and active, and she was seen last at the Fergus Grand Theatre in \"Murder by Natural Causes\", and plans to reappear at this same theatre in \"Peter Pan\" this fall. Before that, she will appear in \"Asphalt Jungle Shorts: The DecaDance\" as part of the Impact 2013 Festival. Jane will also be shooting several short films this fall, including \"Crystal Aggregate.\"",
