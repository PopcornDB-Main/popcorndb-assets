        "biography": "Born and raised in Magdeburg (Germany), Frank Giering gained first stage experience as a background actor at the former known \"Maxim-Gorki\" theatre Magdeburg\". During this time the desire arose to become an actor even though he said at a later time, that this desire was mainly animated due to his hunger to get visible and noticed combined with the unrealistic belief to get more interesting for the womankind.\n\nNevertheless he started his studies at the \"Westf\u00e4lischen Schauspielschule Bochum\" (Germany) but changed short time after to the \"Hochschule f\u00fcr Film und Fernsehen\" (HFF) in Potsdam Babelsberg (Germany). But again he felt quite uncomfortable with the education methods. Some exercises led him to his physical and mental limits. Furthermore he failed on his teacher's demands to \"fill up the space of the theatre\". As he realized that he clenched more and more as soon as he got instructions to \"give more\" or to become \"louder\" he decided to break off.  In front of the film camera - he was able to live out his own belief of acting which was the opposite of the requirements at school. He loved to reduce and to express feelings solely by glances and a minimum of gestures and facial expression. According to his teachers in the theatre he was only able to catch the first row. But now he met the facility - not to gain the last rows by broaden himself - but to bring them closer using the camera. At last he felt like coming home. With his first role he gained the attention of the Austrian director Michael Haneke, who cast him for two of his productions. After the Kafka adaption The Castle (1997), Giering starred the cine film Funny Games (1997). With the figure of the sadistic murderer he became popular over night.\n\nThe final breakthrough followed 1999 with his performance as Floyd in Gigantic (1999) by Sebastian Schipper, a small but particular film about friendship, longing and farewell and a very last but magic night in Hamburg. For a short time he was announced as one of the promising up-and-coming actors of Germany. Comparisons were drawn with James Dean, much less due to similarities in visual nature but due to an aura of \"lostness\" and lonesomeness which both actors surrounded.\n\nFrank Giering died on 23th of June 2010. The official cause of dead is given by multiple organ failure due to an acute bilious colic. On 9th of July 2010 he was buried at the \"Neust\u00e4dter Friedhof\" in Magdeburg (Germany).\n\nDescription above is sections taken from IMDB.",
