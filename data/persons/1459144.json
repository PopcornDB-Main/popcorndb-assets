(She also discovered her interest in directing while on stage for that performance, but that's another story.) As a triple threat, Jane performed in musical theatre for many years, before proceeding to drama and comedies. Favorite roles include \"Eve\" in \"All About Eve\", and \"Lotty\" in \"Enchanted April.\"\n\nUpon transitioning to film & TV, she has since appeared on such hit TV shows as \"The 100\" (CW) and \"The Flash\" (CW), has garnered recurring roles on TV shows \"Wayward Pines\" (Fox) and \"The Returned\" (A&E), along with a role in the feature film \"The Age of Adaline\". She has had the great pleasure of working directly with such luminaries as Melissa Leo, Matt Dilllon, & Toby Jones (Wayward Pines), and Blake Lively (The Age of Adaline).",
