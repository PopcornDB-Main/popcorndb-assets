Widely recognised as one of the greatest actors of all time, he is among the most accomplished and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. Bachchan's dominance in the Indian film industry starting in the early 70s as the \"angry young man\" of Hindi cinema led the French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to describe him as a \"one-man industry\". Bachchan has won numerous major awards in his career, including six National Film Awards (four for Best Actor), and sixteen Filmfare Awards (in addition to a record 42 nominations overall). Bachchan has also worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter, and was an elected member of the Indian Parliament from 1984 to 1987.",
