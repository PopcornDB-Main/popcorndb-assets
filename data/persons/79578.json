        "biography": "Jung Kyung Ho is a South Korean actor under Management Allum. Jung is the son of Jung Eul Young, veteran TV director, and frequent collaborator of writer Kim Soo Hyun in hit television dramas such as \"Mom's Dead Upset\", \"My Husband's Woman\", \"Life Is Beautiful\" and \"Childless Comfort\". Jung Eul Young was initially against his son pursuing acting, but Jung defied his father's wishes and moved out of the family home. Father and son did not speak for three years (they have since reconciled).\n\nJung passed the KBS audition and was soon signed by leading talent agency SidusHQ. Along with four other newcomers from the agency, he made his acting debut in \"5 Stars\", a mobile drama produced by SidusHQ and broadcast over SK Telecom. A few minor roles on KBS followed. Jung's first major break came in the 2004 melodrama series \"I'm Sorry, I Love You\".\n\nTheir respective agencies confirmed in January 2014 that Jung has been dating actress and singer Choi Soo Young from the girl group Girls' Generation since early 2013. They became acquainted as they attended the same church and went to the same university.\n\nIn 2020, Jung starred in hit and critically acclaimed medical drama Hospital Playlist as Kim Jun-wan, an associate professor of cardiothoracic surgery. He reprised his role in season 2 in 2021.",
