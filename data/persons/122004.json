Carmel was also the voice of Smokey Bear in fire safety advertisements, as well as Decepticon Lieutenant Cyclonus, amongst others in the second and third seasons of the popular Transformers animated series. In the TV commercials for the Naugles chain of Mexican fast-food restaurants, he played the character of Se\u00f1or Naugles. He also appeared in Jerry Lewis's comeback 1981 film, Hardly Working.\n\nCarmel starred as Roger Buell in the 1967 NBC sitcom The Mothers-in-Law, but was replaced by Richard Deacon. Officially, Carmel had a salary dispute with producer Desi Arnaz, although, according to rumors, he was fired because his drug use interfered with production.\n\nCarmel was slated to reprise his role as Harry Mudd in the Star Trek: The Next Generation first season finale episode, The Neutral Zone, but died before filming could commence. He died in Hollywood, California, of congestive heart failure due to an enlarged heart muscle.
