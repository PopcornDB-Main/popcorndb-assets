He appeared in a large number of other Warner Bros. films in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nFreelancing after 1948, John Ridgely continued to essay general-purpose parts until he left films in 1953. Thereafter, he worked in summer-theater productions and television until his death from a heart attack at the age of 58 in 1968.",
