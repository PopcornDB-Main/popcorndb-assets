His distinctive voice and southern accent was a good fit for shows featuring rustic characters, especially westerns. He also was portrayed on other shows as a minister, and is probably best remembered as the Reverend Robert Alden in NBC's Little House on the Prairie. Earlier, Greer had a recurring role as Coach Ossie Weiss in the NBC sitcom Hank.",
